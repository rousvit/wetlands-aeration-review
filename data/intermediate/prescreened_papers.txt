AB  - The objective was to evaluate the effects of intermittent artificial aeration cycles and natural zeolite as a support medium, in addition to the contribution of plants (Schoenoplectus californicus) on NH4(+)-N removal during sewage treatment by Constructed Wetlands (CW). Two lines of Mesocosm Constructed Wetland (MCW) were installed: (a) gravel line (i.e. G-Line) and (b) zeolite line (i.e. Z-Line). Aeration increased the NH4(+)-N removal efficiency by 20-45% in the G-Line. Natural zeolite increased the NH4(+)-N removal efficiency by up to 60% in the Z-Line. Plants contributed 15-30% of the NH4(+)-N removal efficiency and no difference between the G-Line and the Z-Line. Conversely, the NH4(+)-N removal rate was shown to only increase with the use of natural zeolite. However, the MCW with natural zeolite, the NH4(+)-N removal rate showed a direct relationship only with the NH4(+)-N influent concentration. Additionally, relationship between the oxygen, energy and area regarding the NH4(+)-N removal efficiency was established for 2.5-12.5 gO2/(kWh-m(2)) in the G-Line and 0.1-2.6 gO2/(kWh-m(2)) in the Z-Line. Finally, it was established that a combination of natural zeolite as a support medium and the aeration strategy in a single CW could regenerate the zeolite's adsorption sites and maintain a given NH4(+)-N removal efficiency over time.

AB  - Pharmaceutical residues in wastewater pose a challenge to wastewater treatment technologies. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are common wastewater treatment systems in rural areas and they discharge often in small water courses in which the ecology can be adversely affected by the discharged pharmaceuticals. Hence, there is a need for studies aiming to improve the removal of pharmaceuticals in CWs. In this study, the performance of a full-scale aerated sub-surface flow hybrid CW treating wastewater from a healthcare facility was studied in terms of common water parameters and pharmaceutical removal. In addition, a preliminary aquatic risk assessment based on hazard quotients was performed to estimate the likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the forest creek where this CW discharges. The (combined) effect of aeration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) was evaluated in a laboratory-scale batch experiment. Excellent removal of the targeted pharmaceuticals was obtained in the full-scale CW (>90%) and, as a result, the aquatic risk was estimated low. The removal efficiency of only a few of the targeted pharmaceuticals was found to be dependent on the applied aeration (namely gabapentin, metformin and sotalol). Longer and the HRT increased the removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac and tramadol.

AB  - Four side-by-side pilot-scale vertical flow (VF) constructed wetlands of different designs were evaluated for the removal of eight widely used emerging organic contaminants from municipal wastewater (i.e. ibuprofen, acetaminophen, diclofenac, tonalide, oxybenzone, triclosan, ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A). Three of the systems were free-draining, with one containing a gravel substrate (VGp), while the other two contained sand substrate (VS1p and VS2p). The fourth system had a saturated gravel substrate and active aeration supplied across the bottom of the bed (VAp). All beds were pulse-loaded on an hourly basis, except VS2p, which was pulse-loaded every 2h. Each system had a surface area of 6.2m(2), received a hydraulic loading rate of 95 mm/day and was planted with Phragmites australis. The beds received an organic loading rate of 7-16 gTOC/m(2)d. The sand-based VF (VS1p) performed significantly better (p<0.05) than the gravel-based wetland (VGp) both in the removal of conventional water quality parameters (TSS, TOC, NH4-N) and studied emerging organic contaminants except for diclofenac (85 ± 17% vs. 74 ± 15% average emerging organic contaminant removal for VS1p and VGp, respectively). Although loading frequency (hourly vs. bi-hourly) was not observed to affect the removal efficiency of the cited conventional water quality parameters, significantly lower removal efficiencies were found for tonalide and bisphenol A for the VF wetland that received bi-hourly dosing (VS2p) (higher volume per pulse), probably due to the more reducing conditions observed in that system. However, diclofenac was the only contaminant showing an opposite trend to the rest of the compounds, achieving higher elimination rates in the wetlands that exhibited less-oxidizing conditions (VS2p and VGp). The use of active aeration in the saturated gravel bed (VAp) generally improved the treatment performance compared to the free-draining gravel bed (VGp) and achieved a similar performance to the free-draining sand-based VF wetlands (VS1p).

AB  - In this study, a side-by-side comparison of two pilot-scale vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (6.2 m(2)×0.85 m, q(i)=95 L/m(2) d, τ(n)=3.5 d) handling primary treated domestic sewage was conducted. One system (VA-i) was set to intermittent aeration while the other was aerated continuously (VAp-c). Intermittent aeration was provided to VA-i in an 8 h on/4 h off pattern. The intermittently aerated wetland, VA-i, was observed to have 70% less nitrate nitrogen mass outflow than the continuously aerated wetland, VAp-c. Intermittent aeration was shown to increase treatment performance for TN while saving 33% of running energy cost for aeration. Parallel tracer experiments in the two wetlands showed hydraulic characteristics similar to one Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). Intermittent aeration did not significantly affect the hydraulic functioning of the system. Hydraulic efficiencies were 78% for VAp-c and 76% for VA-i.

AB  - Aerated treatment wetlands have become an increasingly recognized technology for treating wastewaters from domestic and various industrial origins. To date, treatment wetland aeration is provided by air pumps which require access to the energy grid. The requirement for electricity increases the ecological footprint of an aerated wetland and limits the application of this technology to areas with centralized electrical infrastructure. Wind power offers another possibility as a driver for wetland aeration, but its use for this purpose has not yet been investigated. This paper reports the first experimental trial using a simple wind-driven air pump to replace the conventional electric air blowers of an aerated horizontal subsurface flow wetland. The wind-driven air pump was connected to a two-year old horizontal flow aerated wetland which had been in continuous (24 h) aeration since startup. The wind-driven aeration system functioned, however it was not specifically adapted to wetland aeration. As a result, treatment performance decreased compared to prior continuous aeration. Inconsistent wind speed at the site may have resulted in insufficient pressure within the aeration manifold, resulting in insufficient air supply to the wetland. This paper discusses the lessons learned during the experiment.

AB  - Treatment wetlands have long been used for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment. In recent decades, treatment wetland technology has evolved and now includes intensified designs such as aerated treatment wetlands. Aerated treatment wetlands are particularly dependent on aeration, which requires reliable air pumps and, in most cases, electricity. Whether aerated treatment wetlands are resilient to disturbances such as an aeration interruption is currently not well known. In order to investigate this knowledge gap, we carried out a pilot-scale experiment on one aerated horizontal flow wetland and one aerated vertical flow wetland under warm (Twater>17°C) and cold (Twater<10°C) weather conditions. Both wetlands were monitored before, during and after an aeration interruption of 6d by taking grab samples of the influent and effluent, as well as pore water. The resilience of organic carbon and nitrogen removal processes in the aerated treatment wetlands depended on system design (horizontal or vertical flow) and water temperature. Organic carbon and nitrogen removal for both systems severely deteriorated after 4-5d of aeration interruption, resulting in effluent water quality similar to that expected from a conventional horizontal sub-surface flow treatment wetland. Both experimental aerated treatment wetlands recovered their initial treatment performance within 3-4d at Twater>17°C (warm weather) and within 6-8d (horizontal flow system) and 4-5d (vertical flow system) at Twater<10°C (cold weather). In the vertical flow system, DOC, DN and NH4-N removal were less affected by low water temperatures, however, the decrease of DN removal in the vertical flow aerated wetland at Twater>17°C was twice as high as in the horizontal flow aerated wetland. The quick recovery of treatment performance highlights the benefits of aerated treatment wetlands as resilient wastewater treatment technologies.

AB  - A comparison of the performance of four full-scale aerated horizontal flow constructed wetlands was conducted to determine the efficacy of the technology on sites receiving high and variable ammonia loading rates not yet reported in the literature. Performance was assessed in terms of ammonia and solids removal, hydraulic conductivity and mixing patterns. The capability of systems to produce ammonium effluent concentrations <3 mgNH4+-N/L was observed across all sites in systems receiving variable loadings between 0.1 and 13.0 gNH4+-N/m2/d. Potential resilience issues were observed in relation to response to spike loadings posited to be due to an insufficient nitrifying population within the beds. Hydraulic conductivity and flow mixing patterns observed suggested deterioration of the reactor effective volume over time. Overall, the study demonstrates the efficacy of the technology where ammonium removal is required on small sites receiving high and variable flow rates, with adequate removal of organics and solids, but no significant benefit to the long term hydraulics of the system.

AB  - High rate algal pond (HRAP) was combined with constructed wetland (CW) to intensify nitrogen removal through optimizing nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification process mainly depends on the oxygen content and carbon source level in CWs. Algal biomass was enriched in HRAP, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was increased via photosynthesis. Algal debris increased COD as degradable bioresource. The results showed that HRAP-CW hybrid systems effectively promoted the nitrogen removal performance due to rich DO and COD. The extension of hydraulic retention time in HRAP significantly improved NH4-N and TN removals by 10.9% and 11.1% in hybrid systems, respectively. The highest NH4-N and TN removals in hybrid systems respectively reached 67.2% and 63.5%, which were significantly higher than those in single CW. The study suggested that the hybrid system had the application potentials in nitrogen removal from wastewater.

AB  - Oxygen and carbon source supply are usually insufficient in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. Simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and nitrogen in five batch-operated vertical flow constructed wetlands under different operating conditions was investigated. Alternate aerobic and anaerobic regions were created well with intermittent aeration. Four-month experiments showed that the wetland-applied intermittent aeration combined with step feeding strategy (reactor E) greatly improved the removal of organics, ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and total nitrogen (TN) simultaneously, which were 97, 96, and 82%, respectively. It was much better than non-aerated reactors A and B and outperformed intermittently aerated reactor D without step feeding. Continuous aeration (reactor C) significantly enhanced the organics removal and nitrification, but it limited the TN removal (29%) seriously as a result of low denitrification level, and the high operation cost remained a question. The effect of plants was confirmed in this study, and the monitoring data showed that the plants could grow normally. Intermittent aeration as well as step feeding had no obvious influence on the growth of wetland plants in this study.

AB  - The performance response of eight vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) to different influent COD/N ratios and intermittent aeration in domestic wastewater treatment was investigated. Almost complete nitrification was obtained by intermittent aeration, which well developed alternate anaerobic and aerobic conditions for nitrification and denitrification. Sufficient carbon source supply resulted from influent COD/N ratio of 10 simultaneously obtained high removals of COD (96%), ammonia nitrogen (99%) and total nitrogen (90%) in intermittently aerated VFCWs. In all non-aerated VFCWs, poor nitrification was observed due to oxygen deficiency whilst high COD/N ratios further led to lower COD and nitrogen removal efficiency. The results suggest that intermittent aeration combined with high influent COD/N ratios could achieve high nitrogen removal in VFCWs.

AB  - In this study, an intermittent-aerated subsurface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) A was set up to assess its performance in decentralized rural sewage treatment. A conventional SFCW B and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS C) were also constructed for comparison. Alternate anaerobic and aerobic conditions were well developed by intermittent aeration. High removal of organic pollutants (29.3 gm(-2) d(-1)), ammonium nitrogen (3.5 gm(-2) d(-1)) and total nitrogen (3.3 gm(-2) d(-1)) were obtained simultaneously in SFCW A compared with SFCW B and SWIS C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis proved that the intermittent aeration obviously enhanced the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in SFCW A. These results suggest that intermittent aeration strategy is reliable to enhance the performance of SFCWs in decentralized rural sewage treatment.

AB  - The long-term enhanced removal efficiency of organics and nitrogen in subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs) with and without intermittent aeration for decentralized domestic wastewater was evaluated, and the function of intermittent aeration on microbial community was also investigated in this study. The high and long-term 95.6% COD, 96.1% NH4(+)-N and 85.8% TN removal efficiencies were achieved in experimental intermittently aerated SSF CW compared with non-aerated SSF CW. Aerated SSF CWs also exhibited the excellent removal performance when comparatively comparing with other strategies and techniques applied in CWs. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that associated microbial abundance significantly increased owing to intermittent aeration. These results indicated intermittent aeration CWs might be an effective and sustainable strategy for wastewater treatment in rural areas, but require further full-scale investigation in future.

AB  - Vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetlands at pilot-scale have been applied to treat high hydraulic and organic loads by implementing the following configurations: (1) intermittent recirculation of the treated wastewater from the bottom to the top of the bed, (2) intermittent artificial aeration supplied at the bottom of the bed and (3) the combination of both. These configurations were operated with a saturated bottom layer for a 6h-treatment phase, followed by a free drainage phase prior to a new feeding. COD removal efficiency was 85-90% in all the configurations and removed loads were 54-70 gCOD m(-2)d(-1). The aerated and recirculated wetland resulted in a higher total nitrogen removal (8.6 gN m(-2)d(-1)) due to simultaneous nitrification/denitrification, even in the presence of intermittent aeration (6.8 Nm(3)m(-2)d(-1)). The extra investment needed for implementing aeration/recirculation would be compensated for by a reduction of the surface area per population equivalent, which decreased to 1.5m(2)/PE.

AB  - Increased swine production in North Carolina has resulted in greater waste generation and is demanding some emerging new innovative technologies to effectively treat swine wastewater. One of the cost-effective and passive methods to treat swine wastewater is using constructed wetlands. The objective of this study was to evaluate the N removal under two N loads in 3 different wetland systems: aerated marsh-pond-marsh (M-P-M), aerated marsh-covered pond-marsh (M-FB-M), and continuous marsh (CM) with two days drain and five days flood cycle. Swine wastewater from an anaerobic lagoon was applied to the constructed wetland cells (11 m wide x 40 m length) at two N loading rates of 7 and 12 kg N ha(-1) day(-1)from June to July and August to September 2005, respectively. Weekly inflow and outflow samples were collected for N, P, TS, and COD analysis. Total N reductions (%) at low and high N loading rates were 85.8 and 51.8; 86.3 and 63.3; and 86.2 and 61.8 for M-P-M, M-FB-M, and CM, respectively. Aeration had no significant (P > 0.05) impact on N removal. However, significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed for wetland systems between low and high N loading rates. No difference (P > 0.05) in N reduction was found among wetland systems. Vegetation uptake of N was negligible, ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 %. No significant (P > 0.05) differences in TS and COD removal were observed between the wetland systems.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems sustain human society through the provision of a range of services. However, the status of these ecosystems is threatened by a multitude of pressures, including point sources of wastewater. Future treatment of wastewater will increasingly require new forms of decentralised infrastructure. The research reported here sought to enhance pollutant removal within a novel wastewater treatment technology, based on un-planted, artificially aerated, horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The potential for these systems to treat de-icer contaminated runoff from airports, a source of wastewater that is likely to grow in importance alongside the expansion of air travel and under future climate scenarios, was evaluated. A new configuration for the delivery of air to aerated treatment systems was developed and tested, based on a phased-aeration approach. This new aeration approach significantly improved pollutant removal efficiency compared to alternative aeration configurations, achieving >90% removal of influent load for COD, BOD5 and TOC. Optimised operating conditions under phased aeration were also determined. Based on a hydraulic retention time of 1.5 d and a pollutant mass loading rate of 0.10 kg d-1 m-2 BOD5, >95% BOD5 removal, alongside final effluent BOD5 concentrations <21 mg L-1, could be achieved from an influent characterised by a BOD5 concentration > 800 mg L-1. Key controls on oxygen transfer efficiency within the aerated treatment system were also determined, revealing that standard oxygen transfer efficiency was inversely related to aeration rate between 1 L and 3 L min-1 and positively related to bed media depth between 1500 mm and 3000 mm. The research reported here highlights the potential for optimisation and subsequent widespread application of the aerated wetland technology, in order to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems and the services that they provide to human society.

AB  - An experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland (CW) was tested to treat salt-containing sewage. CW clogging deposits and withered Pontederia cordata L. were collected into a complex fermentation broth to serve as the carbon source and its effects on the denitrification capacity and microbial composition of the CW were examined. Addition of the complex fermentation broth into the CW influent (1.8% salinity) led to high removal efficiencies of NH4+-N > 99.82 ± 0.00% and TN > 90.39 ± 0.05%. Heterotrophic nitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers were entirely dominant in the middle and upper layers of the CW, where obligate halophilic, aerobic denitrifiers Zobellella occurred. The CW successfully cultivated and enriched heterotrophic nitrifying-aerobic denitrifying bacteria, overcoming the effects of salinity and insufficient organic carbon sources on the denitrification capacity of CW. This type of complex carbon sources can also facilitate the utilization of waste resources, such as CW clogging deposits and withered wetland plants.

AB  - Macrophyte combined with artificial aeration is a promising in situ remediation approach for urban rivers polluted with nutrients and organic matter. However, seasonal variations and aeration effects on phytoremediation performance and root-adhered microbial communities are still unclear. In this study, Pontederia cordata was used to treat polluted urban river water under various aeration intensities. Results showed that the highest removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD(Cr)) and total nitrogen (TN) were attained under aeration of 30 L min(-1) in spring and summer and 15 L min(-1) in autumn, while total phosphorus (TP) removal reached maximum with aeration of 15 L min(-1) in all seasons. Moderate aeration was beneficial for increasing the diversity of root-adhered bacteria communities, and the shift of bacterial community structure was more pronounced in spring and autumn with varying aeration intensity. The dual effect, i.e. turbulence and dissolved oxygen (DO), of aeration on the removal of COD(Cr) and TN prevailed over the individual effect of DO, while DO was the most influential factor for TP removal and the root-adhered bacterial community diversity. P. cordata combined with 15 L min(-1) aeration was deemed to be the best condition tested in this study.

AB  - The potential of high-rate TN removal in three aerated horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands to treat high-strength anaerobic digestate supernatant was evaluated. Different strategies of intermittent aeration and effluent recirculation were applied to compare their effect on nitrogen depuration performance. Additional glucose supply and iron-activated carbon based post-treatment systems were established and examined, respectively, to further remove nitrate that accumulated in the effluents from aerated wetlands. The results showed that intermittent aeration (1 h on:1 h off) significantly improved nitrification with ammonium removal efficiency of 90% (18.1 g/(m(2)·d)), but limited TN removal efficiency (53%). Even though effluent recirculation (a ratio of 1:1) increased TN removal from 53% to 71%, the effluent nitrate concentration was still high. Additional glucose was used as a post-treatment option and further increased the TN removal to 82%; however, this implementation caused additional organic pollution. Furthermore, the iron-activated carbon system stimulated with a microelectrolysis process achieved greater than 85% effluent nitrate removal and resulted in 86% TN removal. Considering the high TN removal rate, aerated constructed wetlands integrated with a microelectrolysis-driven system show great potential for treating high-strength digestate supernatant.

AB  - In this study, a novel landscape-activated sludge ecological system (LASeM) was constructed with the advantages of promising treatment, less land need and significant landscape services. Compared to literature, this study provided promising integrated wastewater treatment and landscape for wastewater treatment. This first-attempt study clearly deciphered interactive effect of aeration rate (AR) on nutrient removal and microbial community structure in LASeM. When AR was 0.016m(3)h(-1), the most appropriate removal of COD, NH4(+)-N and TP were 96%, 97% and 74% with the effluent of 14.3, 1.7 and 0.7mgL(-1), respectively, which showed satisfactory capabilities for rural domestic wastewater treatment. According to clone library analysis, Proteobacteria (71%), Bacteroidetes (17%) were found to be the dominant bacterial phylums present in LASeM for biodegradation. In particular, the incorporation of plants altered the microbial community and strengthened capability for the nutrients removal likely due to synergistic interactions among species in the ecosystem.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing the influence of aeration mode and influent COD/N ratio on nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands (CWs). The results showed that a simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) process was established in the intermittent aerated V1. While nitrogen removal pathway gradually changed from partial nitrification-denitrification to complete nitrification-denitrification along with reducing COD/N ratio in the continuous limited aerated V2. Effective inhibition of NOBs under intermittent aeration conditions, good retention of anammox bacteria biomass and much faster depletion of COD prior to substantial NH4+-N conversion jointly led to the successful achievement of stable SNDA process with elevated influent COD/N ratios in V1. Furthermore, the presence of SNAD ensured a robust ammonium (84-92%) and TN (80-91%) removal efficiency in V1 under varying COD loading rates. In contrast, the TN removal efficiency decreased rapidly along with the reducing influent COD/N ratios in V2.

AB  - This study aim to enhance nitrogen removal performance via shifting nitrogen removal pathway from nitrate to nitrite pathway. It was demonstrated that nitrite pathway was successfully and stably achieved in CWs by using modified intermittent aeration control with aeration 20min/non-aeration 100min and reducing DO concentration during aeration, nitrite in the effluent could accumulate to over 70% of the total oxidized nitrogen. Q-PCR analysis showed that nitrifying microbial communities were optimized under the alternating anoxic and aerobic conditions, ammonia oxidizing bacteria increased from 7.15×106 to 8.99×106copies/g, while nitrite oxidizing bacteria decreased approximately threefold after 234days operation. Most importantly, high nitrogen removal efficiency with ammonium removal efficiency of 94.6%, and total nitrogen removal efficiency of 82.6% could be achieved via nitrite pathway even under carbon limiting conditions. In comparison to the nitrate pathway, the nitrite pathway could improve the TN removal by about 55%.

AB  - Mangrove is a special coastal forest along tropical and subtropical intertidal shores. However, how mangroves adapt to tidal flooding and the mechanisms involved in mangrove zonation are still poorly understood. In this study, a pot trial with different tide treatments was conducted to investigate the differences in root anatomy, porosity, radial oxygen loss, iron plaque formation and waterlogging tolerance among six mangroves along a continuous tidal gradient. The index of waterlogging tolerance illustrated that Sonneratia apetala possessed the highest index, followed by Aeguceras corniculatum/Kandelia, Rhizophora stylosa, Heritiera littorlis and Thespesia populnea. Waterlogging tolerances of the mangroves were found to be positively correlated with their root porosity, radial oxygen loss and iron plaque formation. Waterlogging-sensitive species such as landward semi-mangroves exhibited small root porosity and ROL, while waterlogging-tolerant species such as seaward pioneer and rhizophoraceous mangroves exhibited extensive porosity, ROL and iron plaque formation. Nevertheless, grater root porosity and iron plaque formation were detected in permanent waterlogged plants when compared to drained plants. In conclusion, The present study proposes a structural adaptive strategy to tidal flooding in mangroves, such that the mangroves with higher root porosity, ROL and iron plaque appeared to exhibit higher waterlogging tolerance and adaptability in anaerobic foreshores.

AB  - The effects of different aeration methods such as tidal flow (TF), effluent recirculation (ER), and artificial aeration (AA) on the performance of vertical-flow constructed wetland (VFCW), horizontal-flow constructed wetland (HFCW), and hybrid constructed wetland (HCW) are extensively and critically evaluated in this review paper. Aerated constructed wetlands (CWs) demonstrate superior performance compared with non-aerated systems. The removal of total phosphorus (TP) showed substantial variation among different types of CWs and aeration strategies, with mean and standard deviation of 68 ± 20% estimated from all reviewed studies on aerated systems. The TF-VFCW designated the highest removal efficiency and removal rate of 88 ± 6% and 2.6 ± 2.5 g m-2 day-1, respectively, followed by the ER-HCW with values of 79 ± 18% and 1.3 ± 0.7 g m-2 day-1, respectively. The superior performance of TF-VFCW could be attributed to a positive effect of TF in rejuvenating the wetland with fresh air, thus enhancing dissolved oxygen (DO) in the system, and augmenting phosphorus precipitation and adsorption to the substrate. A positive correlation of TP and orthophosphate (PO43--P) with DO indicates that the improvement in DO levels due to redox manipulation with aeration strategies facilitates the phosphorous removal processes (e.g., through precipitation and adsorption to the substrate). The conflicting results on the impact of AA and ER reported by many studies need the cautious interpretation of their impact and require further studies. Only few studies have examined the impact of oxidation-reduction potential on phosphorous removal, which requires more attention in future research, as it appears as an important factor in enhancing the phosphorus removal.

AB  - Intermittent aeration and addition of glucose were applied to horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in order to investigate the effect on pathways of nitrobenzene (NB) degradation and interactions with microbial nitrogen and sulphur transformations. The experiment was carried out in three phases A, B and C consisting of different NB loading and glucose dosing. For each phase, the effect of aeration was assessed by intermittently aerating one wetland and leaving one unaerated. Regardless of whether or not the wetland was aerated, at an influent NB concentration of 140 mg/L, both wetlands significantly reduced NB to less than 2 mg/L, a reduction efficiency of 98%. However, once the influent NB concentration was increased to 280 mg/L, the aerated wetland had a higher removal performance 82% compared to that of the unaerated wetland 71%. Addition of glucose further intensified the NB removal to 95% in the aerated wetlands and 92% in the unaerated. Aeration of wetlands enhanced NB degradation, but also resulted in higher NB volatilization of 6 mg m(-2) d(-1). The detected high concentration of sulphide 20-60 mg/L in the unaerated wetland gave a strong indication that NB may act as an electron donor to sulphate-reducing bacteria, but this should be further investigated. Aeration positively improved NB removal in constructed wetlands, but resulted in higher NB volatilization. Glucose addition induced co-metabolism to enhance NB degradation.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the reduction efficiency of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as well as the removal of color and Amaranth dye metabolites by the Aerobic-anaerobic Baffled Constructed Wetland Reactor (ABCW). The ABCW reactor was planted with common reed (Phragmite australis) where the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 1 day and was fed with synthetic wastewater with the addition of Amaranth dye. Supplementary aeration was supplied in designated compartments of the ABCW reactor to control the aerobic and anaerobic zones. After Amaranth dye addition the COD reduction efficiency dropped from 98 to 91% while the color removal efficiency was 100%. Degradation of azo bond in Amaranth dye is shown by the UV-Vis spectrum analysis which demonstrates partial degradation of Amaranth dye metabolites. The performance of the baffled unit is due to the longer pathway as there is the up-flow and down-flow condition sequentially, thus allowing more contact of the wastewater with the rhizomes and micro-aerobic zones.

AB  - In this study, two lab-scale baffled subsurface-flow constructed wetlands (BSFCWs), including gravel-wood chips-slag and gravel-slag-wood chips, were operated at different intermittent aeration to evaluate the effect of artificial aeration and slow-released carbon source on the treatment efficiency of high-strength nitrogen wastewater. Results indicated that gravel-slag-wood chips extended aerobic/anaerobic alternating environment to gravel and slag zones and maintained anaerobic condition in the subsequent wood chip section. The order of gravel-slag-wood chip was more beneficial to pollutant removal. Sufficient carbon source supply resulted from wood-chip-framework substrate simultaneously obtained high removals of COD (97%), NH4+-N (95%), and TN (94%) in BSFCWs at 2 h aeration per day. The results suggest that intermittent aeration combined with wood chips could achieve high nitrogen removal in BSFCWs.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) removal processing in vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with different designs often varies greatly. Here, a long term VFCWs study for domestic wastewater treatment was carried out to investigate the impact of intermittent aeration and three construction-waste media (common gravel, red brick and fly-ash brick) on N loss, N retention and microbial community. The total nitrogen (TN) removal was significantly higher in aerated VFCWs (91.31%-93.91%) compared with non-aerated VFCWs (12.22%-53.92%), with the highest removal rate in system VI filled with fly-ash brick. Nitrification/denitrification was the main N sink in aerated VFCWs accounting for 36.79%-55.44%, while media storage (8.47%-48.64%) dominated in non-aerated systems because of nitrification limitation. <16% of the TN removal was uptake by plants, and N2O emission contributed about 0.08%-0.39%. Microbial study found that functional bacteria increased with intermittently aeration. The analysis revealed the crucial influence of oxygen supply and media on N transformations in VFCWs.

AB  - To investigate the feasibility of using corncob charcoal substrate in constructed wetlands, four laboratory-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) were built. Effluent pollutant (chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N, total phosphorus (TP)) concentrations during the experiment were determined to reveal pollutant removal mechanisms and efficiencies at different stages. In the stable stage, a VFCW using clay ceramisite substrate under aeration attained higher COD (95.1%), and NH4+-N (95.1%) removal efficiencies than a VFCW using corncob charcoal substrate (91.5% COD, 91.3% NH4+-N) under aeration, but lower TP removal efficiency (clay ceramisite 32.0% and corncob charcoal 40.0%). The VFCW with raw corncob substrate showed stronger COD emissions (maximum concentration 3,108 mg/L) than the corncob charcoal substrate (COD was lower than influent). The VFCW using corncob charcoal substrate performed much better than the VFCW using clay ceramisite substrate under aeration when the C/N ratio was low (C/N = 1.5, TN removal efficiency 36.89%, 4.1% respectively). These results suggest that corncob charcoal is a potential substrate in VFCWs under aeration with a unique self -supplying carbon source property in the denitrification process.

AB  - Nitrogen discharge from decentralized and onsite wastewater treatment systems, such as recirculating sand filters, stabilization ponds, and septic tanks, is an important source of groundwater and surface water contamination. This study demonstrated a simple baffled bioreactor (BBR) technology, operated with an intermittent aeration mode, that effectively removed nearly all nitrogen for small flow wastewater treatment. The BBR is characterized by an aeration zone, followed by an integrated internal settler, which automatically retains a high biomass concentration of approximately 6 g/L without using a separate sludge return device. Long-term testing results indicated that this process had reduced the chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen concentration to approximately 20 mg/L and less than 3 mg-N/L, respectively, under an operational temperature of 7.1 °C to 24.7 °C. The average effluent ammonia and nitrate concentrations were 0.75 and 0.61 mg-N/L, respectively, indicating that both nitrification and denitrification had been completed. In addition to nitrogen removal, this BBR had removed approximately 65% of the total phosphorus.

AB  - It is very important to control methane emissions to mitigate global warming. An intermittent micro-aeration control system was used to control methane emissions from an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVCW) to treat agricultural domestic wastewater pollution in this study. The optimized intermittent micro-aeration conditions were a 20-min aeration time and 340-min non-aeration time, 3.9 m3 h-1 aeration intensity, evenly distributed micro-aeration diffusers at the tank bottom, and an aeration period of every 6 h. Methane flux emission by intermittent micro-aeration was decreased by 60.7% under the optimized conditions. The average oxygen transfer efficiency was 26.73%. The control of CH4 emission from IVCWs was most strongly influenced by the intermittent micro-aeration diffuser distribution, followed by aeration intensity, aeration time, and water depth. Scaling up of IVCWs is feasible in rural areas by using intermittent micro-aeration control as a mitigation measure for methane gas emissions for climate change.

AB  - Seasonal variations and aeration effects on water quality improvements and the physiological responses of Nymphaea tetragona Georgi were investigated with mesocosm experiments. Plants were hydroponically cultivated in six purifying tanks (aerated, non-aerated) and the characteristics of the plants were measured. Water quality improvements in purifying tanks were evaluated by comparing to the control tanks. The results showed that continuous aeration affected the plant morphology and physiology. The lengths of the roots, petioles and leaf limbs in aeration conditions were shorter than in non-aeration conditions. Chlorophyll and soluble protein contents of the leaf limbs in aerated tanks decreased, while peroxidase and catalase activities of roots tissues increased. In spring and summer, effects of aeration on the plants were less than in autumn. Total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4(+)-N) in aerated tanks were lower than in non-aerated tanks, while total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved phosphorus (DP) increased in spring and summer. In autumn, effects of aeration on the plants became more significant. TN, NH4(+)-N, TP and DP became higher in aerated tanks than in non-aerated tanks in autumn. This work provided evidences for regulating aeration techniques based on seasonal variations of the plant physiology in restoring polluted stagnant water.

AB  - This study investigated the treatment performance and nitrogen removal mechanism of highly alkaline ammonia-stripped digestate effluent in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs). A promising nitrogen removal performance (up to 91%) was observed in CWs coupled with intensified configurations, i.e., aeration and effluent recirculation. The results clearly supported that the higher aeration ratio and presence of effluent recirculation are important to improve the alkalinity and pollutant removal in CWs. The influent pH (>10) was significantly decreased to 8.2-8.8 under the volumetric hydraulic loading rates of 0.105 and 0.21 d-1 in the CWs. Simultaneously, up to 91% of NH4+-N removal was achieved under the operation of a higher aeration ratio and effluent recirculation. Biological nitrogen transformations accounted for 94% of the consumption of alkalinity in the CWs. The significant enrichment of δ15N-NH4+ in the effluent (47-58‰) strongly supports the occurrence of microbial transformations for NH4+-N removal. However, relatively lower enrichment factors of δ15N-NH4+ (-1.8‰ to -11.6‰) compared to the values reported in previous studies reflected the inhibition effect of the high pH alkaline environment on nitrifiers in these CWs.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by constructed wetlands (CWs) could mitigate the environmental benefits of nutrient removal in these man-made ecosystems. We studied the effect of 3 different macrophyte species and artificial aeration on the rates of nitrous oxide (N(2)O), carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) production in CW mesocosms over three seasons. CW emitted 2-10 times more GHG than natural wetlands. Overall, CH(4) was the most important GHG emitted in unplanted treatments. Oxygen availability through artificial aeration reduced CH(4) fluxes. Plant presence also decreased CH(4) fluxes but favoured CO(2) production. Nitrous oxide had a minor contribution to global warming potential (GWP<15%). The introduction of oxygen through artificial aeration combined with plant presence, particularly Typha angustifolia, had the overall best performance among the treatments tested in this study, including lowest GWP, greatest nutrient removal, and best hydraulic properties.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) processing in constructed wetlands (CWs) is often variable, and the contribution to N loss and retention by various pathways (nitrification/denitrification, plant uptake and sediment storage) remains unclear. We studied the seasonal variation of the effects of artificial aeration and three different macrophyte species (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia and Phalaris arundinacea) on N processing (removal rates, transformations and export) using experimental CW mesocosms. Removal of total nitrogen (TN) was higher in summer and in planted and aerated units, with the highest mean removal in units planted with T. angustifolia. Export of ammonium (NH(4)(+)), a proxy for nitrification limitation, was higher in winter, and in unplanted and non-aerated units. Planted and aerated units had the highest export of oxidized nitrogen (NO(y)), a proxy for reduced denitrification. Redox potential, evapotranspiration (ETP) rates and hydraulic retention times (HRT) were all predictors of TN, NH(4)(+) and NO(y) export, and significantly affected by plants. Denitrification was the main N sink in most treatments accounting for 47-62% of TN removal, while sediment storage was dominant in unplanted non-aerated units and units planted with P. arundinacea. Plant uptake accounted for less than 20% of the removal. Uncertainties about the long-term fate of the N stored in sediments suggest that the fraction attributed to denitrification losses could be underestimated in this study.

AB  - Treatment wetlands (TWs) have shown good capacity in dye removal from textile wastewater. However, the high hydraulic retention times (HRTs) required by these solutions and the connected high area requirements, remain a big drawback towards the application of TWs for dye treatment at full scale. Aerated TWs are interesting intensified solutions that attempt to reduce the TW required area. Therefore, an aerated CW pilot plant, composed of a 20 m2 horizontal subsurface flow TW (HF) and a 21 m2 Free Water System (FWS), equipped with aeration pipelines, was built and monitored to investigate the potential reduction of required area for dye removal from the effluent wastewater of a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). During a 8 months long study, experimenting with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs - 1.2, 2.6 and 3.5 days) and aeration modes (intermittent and continuous), the pilot plant has shown a normal biological degradation for organic matter and nutrients, while the residual dye removal has been very low, as demonstrated by the absorbance measure at three wavelengths: at 426 nm (blue) the removal varies from -55% at influent absorbance of 0.010 to 41% at 0.060; at 558 nm (yellow) the removal is negative at 0.005 (-58%) and high at higher influent concentrations (72% at 0.035 of absorbance for the inlet); at 660 nm (red) -82% of removal efficiency was obtained at influent absorbance of 0.002 and 74% at 0.010. These results are a consequence of the biological oxidation processes taking place in the WWTP, so that the residual dye seems to be resistant to further aerobic degradation. Therefore, TWs enhanced by aeration can provide only a buffer effect on peak dye concentrations.

AB  - Ecosystem pollution due to the lack of or inefficient wastewater treatment coverage in small communities is still a matter of great concern, even in developed countries. This study assesses the seasonal performance of 4 different full-scale wastewater technologies that have been used in small communities (<2000 population equivalent) for more than 10 years in terms of emerging contaminant (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and NH4-N removal efficiency. The studied technologies, which were selected due to their widespread use, included two intensive treatment systems (an extended aeration system (AS) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC)) and two extensive treatment systems (a constructed wetland (CW) and a waste stabilization pond (WSP)), all located in north-eastern Spain. The studied compounds belonged to the groups of pharmaceuticals, sunscreen compounds, fragrances, antiseptics, flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides and plasticizers. The 25 ECs occurred in wastewater at concentrations ranging from undetectable to 80 μg L(-1). The average removal efficiency was 42% for the CW, 62% for the AS, 63% for the RBC and 82% for the WSP. All the technologies except the WSP system showed seasonal variability in the removal of ECs. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that, whilst all the technologies were capable of decreasing the aquatic risk, only the WSP yielded no risk in both seasons.

AB  - Conservative tracer experiments, and spatial temperature and dissolved oxygen mapping within four subsurface treatment wetlands employed in this study demonstrated the importance of supplemental aeration and vegetation in reducing preferential flows in cold climate treatment wetlands. Four constructed wetlands, employing horizontal subsurface flow were used to treat dairy wastewater in a 2 x 2 factorial design consisting of two wetland cells with vegetation and two with supplemental aeration. Four tracer studies were conducted between November 2004 and May 2005. Two key observations were made, demonstrating that vegetation and aeration can be utilized in cold regions to prevent clogging and freezing, thereby reducing preferential flow paths which can reduce treatment efficiencies: (1) vegetation contributed to thermal protection and (2) aeration increased temperature and mixing. A comparison of multiple wetland cells with varying flow rates showed that the use of pore volume in tracer response curves was a better indicator of preferential flows than other indicators including volumetric efficiency, hydraulic efficiency and number of continuosly stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). This research helps further establish how constructed wetlands are a viable tool for treating wastewater in cold climates.

AB  - In aerated treatment wetlands, oxygen availability is not a limiting factor in sustaining a high level of nitrification in wastewater treatment. In the case of an air blower failure, nitrification would cease, potentially causing adverse effects to the nitrifying bacteria. A field trial was completed investigating nitrification loss when aeration is switched off, and the system recovery rate after the aeration is switched back on. Loss of dissolved oxygen was observed to be more rapid than loss of nitrification. Nitrate was observed in the effluent long after the aeration was switched off (48h+). A complementary modeling study predicted nitrate diffusion out of biofilm over a 48h period. After two weeks of no aeration in the established system, nitrification recovered within two days, whereas nitrification establishment in a new system was previously observed to require 20-45days. These results suggest that once established resident nitrifying microbial communities are quite robust.

AB  - A pilot-scale subsurface-flow constructed wetland was installed at the Jones County Municipal Landfill, near Anamosa, Iowa, in August 1999 to demonstrate the use of constructed wetlands as a viable low-cost treatment option for leachate generated at small landfills. The system was equipped with a patented wetland aeration process to aid in removal of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen. The high iron content of the leachate caused the aeration system to cease 2 years into operation. Upon the installation of a pretreatment chamber for iron removal and a new aeration system, treatment efficiencies dramatically improved. Seasonal performance with and without aeration is reported for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)-N). Since winter air temperatures in Iowa can be very cold, a layer of mulch insulation was installed on top of the wetland bed to keep the system from freezing. When the insulation layer was properly maintained (either through sufficient litterfall or replenishing the mulch layer), the wetland sustained air temperatures of as low as -26 degrees C without freezing problems.

AB  - Combination of aerobic and anaerobic processes in constructed wetlands can enhance the treatment performance in textile wastewater. This study assessed the treatment of azo dye Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and nutrients using five laboratory-scale up-flow constructed wetlands (UFCW) with and without supplementary aeration, and with different emergent plants. Supplementary aeration controlled the size of aerobic and anaerobic zones in the UFCW reactors as evidenced by the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) profile of the UFCW. The AO7 removal efficiency was above 95% in all UFCW reactors and most of the color was extensively removed in the anaerobic region of the UFCW beds. The intermediates produced through the breakage of azo bond were significantly reduced in the UFCW reactors with supplementary aeration. The results indicated the applicability of the UFCW reactors to the treatment of azo dye-containing wastewater. The removals of T-N and T-P were in the range of 60-67% and 26-37%, respectively, among the UFCW reactors. The COD and NH(4)-N removals in the aerated reactors were about 86 and 96%, respectively. On the other hand, the COD and NH(4)-N removals were in the range of 78-82% and 41-48%, respectively, in the non-aerated reactors. The supplementary aeration enhanced the removal efficiencies in organic matter, NH(4)-N and aromatic amines in the UFCW reactors.

AB  - The objective of present study was to assess the simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and nutrients by five laboratory scale up-flow constructed wetlands (UFCWs). Aerobic and anaerobic regions were well developed at the upper and lower beds, respectively, in the UFCW reactors with supplementary aeration. The emergent plants employed were Phragmites australis and Manchurian wild rice. The COD, T-N, T-P, NH(4)-N and NO(3)-N removal efficiencies for the UFCW reactors were in the range of 90-94%, 69-92%, 29-52%, 59-98% and 45-100%, respectively. The organic matter and NH(4)-N removal efficiencies in the aerated wetland reactors were better than the non-aerated wetland reactors. The supplementary aeration has enhanced the aerobic biodegradation of organic matter and nitrification. The Manchurian wild rice outperformed P. australis in the removals of T-P, T-N and NH(4)-N.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine and compare the treatment performance of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) containing wastewater by up-flow constructed wetland (UFCW) at different AO7 concentrations, hydraulic retention times (HRT) and alternative of supplementary aeration. The aerated wetland reactor outperformed the non-aerated one in the removal of organic matters, NH(4)-N and aromatic amines. The T-P removal efficiency for both wetland reactors was not much different throughout the study and the supplementary aeration showed no significant effect on T-P removal. As influent AO7 concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg/L, the performance in biodegradation of organic matters and nitrification in the non-aerated wetland reactor, and denitrification and decolorization in the aerated wetland reactor were affected. As HRT increased from 3 to 6 d, the removal of NH(4)-N and NO(3)-N in the aerated wetland reactor was not significantly different, but the NH(4)-N removal efficiency improved tremendously in the non-aerated wetland reactor.

AB  - This study investigates the role of plant (Elodea nuttallii) and effect of supplementary aeration on wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation in an up-flow constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (UFCW-MFC). Aeration rates were varied from 1900 to 0mL/min and a control reactor was operated without supplementary aeration. 600mL/min was the optimum aeration flow rate to achieve highest energy recovery as the oxygen was sufficient to use as terminal electron acceptor for electrical current generation. The maximum voltage output, power density, normalized energy recovery and Coulombic efficiency were 545.77±25mV, 184.75±7.50mW/m3, 204.49W/kg COD, 1.29W/m3 and 10.28%, respectively. The variation of aeration flow rates influenced the NO3- and NH4+ removal differently as nitrification and denitrification involved conflicting requirement. In terms of wastewater treatment performance, at 60mL/min aeration rate, UFCW-MFC achieved 50 and 81% of NO3- and NH4+ removal, respectively. E. nuttallii enhanced nitrification by 17% and significantly contributed to bioelectricity generation.

AB  - The HIGHWET project combines the hydrolytic up-flow sludge bed (HUSB) anaerobic digester and constructed wetlands (CWs) with forced aeration for decreasing the footprint and improving effluent quality. The HIGHWET plant in A Coruña (NW of Spain) treating municipal wastewater consists of a HUSB and four parallel subsurface horizontal flow (HF) CWs. HF1, HF2 and HF3 units are fitted with forced aeration, while the control HF4 is not aerated. All the HF units are provided with effluent recirculation, but different heights of gravel bed (0.8 m in HF1 and HF2, and 0.5 m in HF3 and HF4) are implemented. Besides, a tobermorite-enriched material was added in the HF2 unit in order to improve phosphorus removal. The HUSB 76-89% of total suspended solids (TSS) and about 40% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). Aerated HF units reached above 96% of TSS, COD and BOD at a surface loading rate of 29-47 g BOD5/m2·d. An aeration regime ranging from 5 h on/3 h off to 3 h on/5 h off was found to be adequate to optimize nitrogen removal, which ranged from 53% to 81%. Average removal rates of 3.4 ± 0.4 g total nitrogen (TN)/m2·d and 12.8 ± 3.7 g TN/m3·d were found in the aerated units, being 5.5 and 4.1 times higher than those of the non-aerated system. The tobermorite-enriched HF2 unit showed a distinct higher phosphate (60-67%) and total phosphorus (54%) removal.

AB  - The effect of step feed strategy and intermittent aeration on removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen was investigated in a laboratory scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSFCW). Wetland was divided into four zones along the length (zone I to IV), and influent was introduced into first and third zones by step feeding. Continuous study was carried out in four phases. In phases I to III, 30% of influent was bypassed to zone III for denitrification along with organics removal. Intermittent aeration was provided only in zone II at 2.5 L/min for 4 h/day, during phases II, III and IV. In phase I, 87% COD and 43% NH4+-N (ammonia-nitrogen) removal were obtained from influents of 331 and 30 mg/L, respectively. In phase II study, external aeration resulted in 97% COD and 71% NH4+-N removal in the wetland. In phase IV, 40% of feed was delivered to zone III. Higher supply of organic in zone III resulted in higher denitrification, and total nitrogen removal rate increased to 70% from 56%. In the final effluent, concentration of NO3--N was 9-11 mg/L in phase I to III and decreased to 4 mg/L in phase IV. Batch study showed that COD and NH4+-N removal followed first order kinetics in different zones of wetland.

AB  - This research evaluated the feasibility of using vetiver plantlets (Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash) on a floating platform with aeration to degrade phenol (500 mg/L) in illegally dumped industrial wastewater (IDIWW). The IDIWW sample was from the most infamous illegal dumping site at Nong Nae subdistrict, Phanom Sarakham district, Chachoengsao province, Thailand. Laboratory results suggested that phenol degradation by vetiver involves two phases: Phase I, phytopolymerization and phyto-oxidation assisted by root-produced peroxide (H2O2) and peroxidase (POD), followed by phase II, a combination of phase I with enhanced rhizomicrobial degradation. The first 360-400 h of phenol degradation were dominated by phytopolymerization and phyto-oxidation yielding particulate polyphenols (PPP) or particulate organic matter (POM) as by-products, while phenol decreased to around 145 mg/L. In Phase II, synergistically, rhizomicrobial growth was ∼100-folds greater on the roots of the vetiver plantlets than in the IDIWW and participated in the microbial degradation of phenol at this lower phenol concentration, increasing the phenol degradation rate by more than three folds. This combination of phytochemical and rhizomicrobiological processes eliminated phenol in IDIWW in less than 766 h (32 days), while without the vetiver plantlets, phenol degradation by aerated microbial degradation alone may require 235 days. To our knowledge, this is the first that systematically reveals the complete phenol degradation mechanism by vetiver plantlets in real aerated wastewater.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the role of cyclic aeration, vegetation, and temperature on nitrogen removal by subsurface-flow engineered wetlands. Aeration was shown to enhance total nitrogen and ammonia removal and to enhance removal of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and phosphorus. Effluent ammonia and total nitrogen concentrations were significantly lower in aerated wetland cells when compared with unaerated cells. There was no significant difference in nitrogen removal between planted and unplanted cells. Effluent total nitrogen concentrations ranged from 9 to 12 mg N/L in the aerated cells and from 23 to 24 mg N/L in unaerated cells. Effluent ammonia concentrations ranged from 3 to 7 mg N/L in aerated wetland cells and from 22 to 23 mg N/L in unaerated cells. For the conditions tested, temperature had only a minimal effect on effluent ammonia or total nitrogen concentrations. The tanks-in-series and the PkC models predicted the general trends in effluent ammonia and total nitrogen concentrations, but did not do well predicting short-term variability. Rate coefficients for aerated systems were 2 to 10 times greater than those for unaerated systems.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of aeration and vegetation on the removal of organic matter in coffee processing wastewater (CPW) treated in 4 constructed wetlands (CWs), characterized as follows: (i) ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) cultivated system operating with an aerated influent; (ii) non-cultivated system operating with an aerated influent, (iii) ryegrass cultivated system operating with a non-aerated influent; and (iv) non-cultivated system operating with a non-aerated influent. The lowest average chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiencies of 87, 84 and 73%, respectively, were obtained in the ryegrass cultivated system operating with a non-aerated influent. However, ryegrass cultivation did not influence the removal efficiency of organic matter. Artificial aeration of the CPW, prior to its injection in the CW, did not improve the removal efficiencies of organic matter. On other hand it did contribute to increase the instantaneous rate at which the maximum COD removal efficiency was reached. Although aeration did not result in greater organic matter removal efficiencies, it is important to consider the benefits of aeration on the removal of the other compounds.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) loss by various pathways in constructed wetlands (CWs) is often variable. The effects of intermittent aeration and different construction waste substrates (gravel, red brick, fly-ash brick) on P processing using six batch-operated vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) were studied for decentralized domestic wastewater treatment. Average removal of total phosphorus (TP) in three aerated CWs was markedly higher (21.06, 24.83, and 27.02 mg m-2 day-1, respectively) than non-aerated CWs (10.64, 18.16, and 25.09 mg m-2 day-1, respectively). Fly-ash brick offered superior TP removal efficiency in both aerated and non-aerated batch-operated VFCWs, suggesting its promising application for P removal in CWs. Aeration greatly promoted plant growth and thusly increased plant uptake of P by 0.57-1.45 times. Substance storage was still the main P sink accounting for 23.92-59.47% of TP removal. Other process including microbial uptake was revealed to be a very important P removal pathway (accounting for 14.86-34.84%). The contribution of microbial uptake was also indicated by microbial analysis. Long-term results suggested that the contribution of microbial P uptake could be always ignored and underestimated in most CWs. A combination of intermittent aeration and suitable substrates is effective to intensify P transformation in CWs.

AB  - The present study explores low-cost cathode development possibility using radial oxygen loss (ROL) of Canna indica plants and intermittent aeration (IA) for wastewater treatment and electricity generation in constructed wetland-microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) system. Two CW-MFC microcosms were developed. Amongst them, one microcosm was planted with Canna indica plants for evaluating the ROL dependent cathode reaction (CW-MFC dependent on ROL) and another microcosm was equipped with intermittent aeration for evaluating the intermittent aeration dependent cathode reaction (CW-MFC with additional IA). The CW-MFC with additional IA has achieved 78.71% and 53.23%, and CW-MFC dependent on ROL has achieved 72.17% and 46.77% COD removal from synthetic wastewater containing glucose loads of 0.7gL-1and 2.0gL-1, respectively. The maximum power density of 31.04mWm-3 and 19.60mWm-3 was achieved in CW-MFC with additional IA and CW-MFC dependent on ROL, respectively.

AB  - An up-flow vertical flow constructed wetland (AC-VFCW) filled with ceramsite and 5% external carbon source poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) as substrate was set for nitrogen removal with micro aeration. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process was observed with 90.4% NH4+-N and 92.1% TN removal efficiencies. Nitrification and denitrification genes were both preferentially enriched on the surface of PHBV. Nitrogen transformation along the flow direction showed that NH4+-N was oxidized to NO3--N at the lowermost 10 cm of the substrate and NO3--N gradually degraded over the depth. AmoA gene was more enriched at -10 and -50 cm layers. NirS gene was the dominant functional gene at the bottom layer with the abundance of 2.05 × 107 copies g-1 substrate while nosZ gene was predominantly abundant with 7.51 × 106 and 2.64 × 106 copies g-1 substrate at the middle and top layer, respectively, indicating that functional division of dominant nitrogen functional genes forms along the flow direction in AC-VFCW.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of aeration and/or vegetation in experimental constructed wetlands (CWs) as mesocosms on the removal of pollutants in oak wood leachate. Twelve outdoor wetland mesocosms, with randomized replicated treatment combinations of vegetation (Phragmites australis) and aeration was monitored during the second and third year after construction. The investigation included control tanks with no aeration and no vegetation. The parameters monitored were polyphenols (PPs), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and water colour. The reduction of COD after 28 days was approx. 50% and more than 50% of PPs, whereas only 40% of the water colour was removed. Aeration increased the effect of both COD and PP removal. The vegetation treatment had a small but significant effect on removal of COD. The vegetation + aeration treatment, as well as aeration alone, increased the removal efficiency of COD from 9.5 g m(-3) d(-1) in the control to 11 g m(-3) d(-1). The results suggest that CWs can be used to treat stormwater contaminated by oak wood leachate. Further, it is suggested that the main processes for removal of pollutants in the leachate occur in the open-water habitat and that the hydraulic retention time is more important for removal than aeration and vegetation related processes.

AB  - Forced aeration of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) is nowadays a recognized method to improve treatment efficiency, mainly in terms of ammonium removal. While numerous investigations have been reported testing constant aeration, scarce information can be found about the efficiency of intermittent aeration. This study aims at comparing continuous and intermittent aeration, establishing if there is an optimal regime that will increase treatment efficiency of HSSF CWs whilst minimizing the energy requirement. Full and intermittent aeration were tested in a pilot plant of three HSSF CWs (2.64m(2) each) fed with primary treated wastewater. One unit was fully aerated; one intermittently aerated (i.e. by setting a limit of 0.5mg/L dissolved oxygen within the bed) with the remaining unit not aerated as a control. Results indicated that intermittent aeration was the most successful operating method. Indeed, the coexistence of aerobic and anoxic conditions promoted by the intermittent aeration resulted in the highest COD (66%), ammonium (99%) and total nitrogen (79%) removals. On the other hand, continuous aeration promotes ammonium removal (99%), but resulted in nitrate concentrations in the effluent of up to 27mg/L. This study demonstrates the high potential of the intermittent aeration to increase wastewater treatment efficiency of CWs providing an extreme benefit in terms of the energy consumption.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) contained in sewage maybe removed by mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (MCW), although removal efficiency is only between 20% and 60%. P removal can be enhanced by increasing wetland adsorption capacity using special media, like natural zeolite, operating under aerobic conditions (oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) above +300 mV). The objective of this study was to evaluate P removal in sewage treated by MCW with artificial aeration and natural zeolite as support medium for the plants. The study compared two parallel lines of MCW: gravel and zeolite. Each line consisted in two MCW in series, where the first MCW of each line has artificial aeration. Additionally, four aeration strategies were evaluated. During the operation, the following parameters were measured in each MCW: pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and ORP. Phosphate (PO4(-3) - P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS) and ammonium. (NH4(+) - N) were evaluated in influents and effluents. Plant growth (biomass) and proximate analysis for P content into Schoenoplectus californicus were also performed. The results showed that PO4(-3) - P removal efficiency was 70% in the zeolite medium, presenting significant differences (p < .05) with the results obtained by the gravel medium. Additionally, aeration was found to have a significant effect (p < .05) only in the gravel medium with an increase in up to 30% for PO43 - P removal. Thus, S. californicus contributed to 10-20% of P removal efficiency.

AB  - Seasonal effects of pre-aeration on microbial nitrogen performance in constructed wetlands (CWs) involved with anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process were investigated in this study. Slow natural re-aeration rate was the inhibiting factor for total nitrogen removal in CW without pre-aeration, and partial nitrification was the main way for nitrite generation. Besides partial nitrification, pre-aeration provided nitrite generation in CWs with an alternative way: nitrate reduction. Advantage of pre-aeration of influent was much different under various temperature ranges. Mean temperature of 15 °C seemed to be the turning point. With a mean temperature of or higher than 15 °C, nitrate in the influent effectively improved nitrogen removal in CWs. With a mean temperature lower than 15 °C, the nitrate reduction process in CWs was greatly inhibited. The benefit of pre-aeration was weak under this temperature range. Seasonal aeration pattern for the pre-treatment of HSSF CWs might be a more energy-saving alternative in in-suit domestic sewage treatment.

AB  - Given that few studies investigated the effects of aeration position (AP) on the performance of aerated constructed wetlands, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of AP on organics, nitrogen and phosphorus removal in lab-scale combined oxidation pond-constructed wetland (OP-CW) systems. Results showed that middle aeration allowed the CW to possess more uniform oxygen distribution and to achieve greater removals of COD and NH3-N, while the CW under bottom aeration and surface aeration demonstrated more distinct stratification of oxygen distribution and surface aeration brought about better TN removal capacity for the OP-CW system. However, no significant influence of artificial aeration or AP on TP removal was observed. Overall, AP could significantly affect the spatial distribution of dissolved oxygen by influencing the oxygen diffusion paths in aerated CWs, thereby influencing the removal of pollutants, especially organics and nitrogen, which offers a reference for the design of aerated CWs.

AB  - This study evaluated the performance of a continuous flow structured-bed reactor in the simultaneous removal of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the effluent from an animal food plant. The reactor had an intermittent aeration system; hydraulic retention time (HRT) of one day; temperature of 30 °C; and recirculation ratio of five times the flow. An experimental central composite rotational delineation (CCRD) type design was used to define the aeration conditions and nitrogen load (factors) to be studied. Response surface methodology was used to analyse the influence of the factors above the results, the removal of TN and COD. It was observed that the aeration factor showed the greatest significance for the results and that the affluent TKN concentration did not have a significant effect, at a 95% level of confidence, on COD removal. Throughout the experiment, the COD/N ratio remained between 3.2 and 3.8. The best results for COD and TN removal, 80% and 88%, respectively, were obtained with 158 min of aeration on a cycle of 180 min and 255 mg L(-1) of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) in the substrate.

AB  - In this study, the removal performances of organic pollutants and nitrogen in vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with and without intermittent aeration fed with different strengths of influent were evaluated as a possible treatment for decentralized domestic wastewater in northern China. The intermittent aeration strategy not only significantly increased removal efficiencies of organic pollutants and ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), but also successfully created alternate aerobic and anaerobic conditions resulting in high total nitrogen (TN) removal. Moreover, increasing influent strength did not affect the removal efficiencies of organic matters and nitrogen in aerated VFCWs. Compared with non-aerated VFCWs, much higher removal of organic pollutants (96%), NH4(+)-N (98%), and TN (85%) was obtained simultaneously in intermittent aeration VFCWs, especially at high influent strengths. The results suggest that the intermittent aeration could be an appropriate strategy for achieving the high removal performance in VFCWs, especially for in-situ treatment of high strength decentralized domestic wastewaters.

AB  - In this study, a novel sludge-ceramsite was applied as main substrate in intermittent-aerated subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs) for treating decentralized domestic wastewater, and intensified organics and nitrogen removal in different SSF CWs (with and without intermittent aeration, with and without sludge-ceramsite substrate) were evaluated. High removal of 97.2% COD, 98.9% NH4(+)-N and 85.8% TN were obtained simultaneously in the intermittent-aerated CW system using sludge-ceramsite substrate compared with non-aerated CWs. Moreover, results from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in the intermittent-aerated CW system with sludge-ceramsite substrate was enhanced, thus indicating that the application of intermittent aeration and sludge-ceramsite plays an important role in nitrogen transformations. These results suggest that a combination of intermittent aeration and sludge-ceramsite substrate is reliable to enhance the treatment performance in SSF CWs.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess whether the improved configuration of vertical upflow constructed wetlands (CWs) coupled with aeration in the centre part and effluent recirculation can strengthen the treatment performance of high strength anaerobic digestate supernatant. Moreover, electricity generation and bacterial community characteristics were also examined. The results indicated that intermittent aeration in vertical upflow CWs significantly enhanced organic matter (>69%, 214-401g/m2d) and ammonium (>92%, 62-138g/m2d) removal, regardless of aeration position. However, the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) was limited to 24%-40%. Effluent recirculation was examined to enhance TN removal up to 69% in the central aerated CW, as compared to 44% observed in the bottom aerated CW. Accordingly, significantly higher abundances of denitrifiers (nirK and nirS) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria (anammox) were found in the bottom layer of the central aerated CW. In addition, the central aerated CW coupled with effluent recirculation generated significantly higher electricity (maximum power density of 112mW/m2) than traditional bottom aerated CWs when integrated with a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Results confirmed the application potential of this new configuration of upflow CW integrated with central aeration and effluent recirculation.

AB  - In this study, the performances of nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands using solid carbon source with limited aeration were investigated. The blends of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) and polyacetic acid (PLA) were used as the carbon source and biofilm support. The performances of nitrogen removal, microbial abundance and microbial community structure in the biofilm attached on PHBV/PLA were investigated. Higher ammonia removal efficiency (91.00%) and total nitrogen removal efficiency (97.03%) than non-aerated constructed wetland (System NA) were achieved in constructed wetland with limited aeration (System A). The limited aeration decreased the average concentrations of COD in effluent. And, System A had higher microbial abundance than System NA. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that denitrifying bacteria Brevinema (41.85%) and Thiothrix (12.33%) were the predominant genus in the biofilm attached on the carbon source in System NA and System A, respectively.

AB  - The low hydraulic loading rate (HLR) greatly restricts the wide application of subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS) in densely populated areas. To increase the HLR, an innovative SWIS was developed using cyclic operation mode. In each cycle, a wastewater feeding period is followed by a drying period, in which the aeration is conducted by a medium-pressure fan. Results indicated that the removal rate of TOC and NH4(+)-N were more than 85% at HLR of 0.5m(3)/m(2)d, whereas the TN removal rate was lower than 20%, indicating that the aeration was efficient and denitrification process was largely limited in the SWIS. When HLR decreased from 0.5 to 0.2m(3)/m(2)d, the pollutant removal efficiency enhanced slightly except for TN. Overall, the intermittent operation and micro-power aeration, combined with shunting the pollutant loading were really helpful for SWIS to achieve higher HLR, which offers a reference for the design of innovative SWIS.

AB  - The large area demand of constructed wetlands (CWs) is documented as a weak point that can be potentially reduced by applying active aeration. The aim of this study was, therefore, to understand the effects of aeration on the treatment performance, the biofilm activity, the protozoan population size and potential CW footprint reduction of different horizontal flow (HF) CW configurations. Two experimental periods were considered: a first period with low organic loading rate (OLR) and a second period with high OLR. Three HF CW configurations were compared: a conventional (control), an aerated and a hybrid CW (aerated followed by a non-aerated CW). The results obtained reinforced the competence of aerated CW for organic matter removal (81-89% of chemical oxygen demand) while for nitrogen elimination the control (19-24%) and hybrid (8-41%) systems performed better than the aerated system (-6% to 33%). Biofilm activity and protozoa abundance were distinctly higher at the inlet zones when compared with the outlet zones of all CWs, as well as in the aerated systems when compared with the non-aerated CWs. The protozoan abundance increased with an increase in the OLR and ciliates were found to be the dominant group. Overall, the active aeration highlighted the efficiency and stability of the CWs for organic matter removal and thus can be used as a promising tool to enhance microbial activity and grazing by protozoa; eventually reducing solid accumulation in the bed media. These beneficial effects contribute to reduce the CWs' area requirements.

AB  - The Duplex-constructed wetland (CW) is a hybrid system composed of a vertical flow (VF) CW on top of a horizontal flow filter (HFF). Each compartment is designed to play a different role: aerobic treatment in the VF CW due to intermittent feeding and anoxic treatment in the HFF due to saturated conditions. Three Duplex-CWs were used in this study: Control, Aerated and Recirculating. The role of each compartment was tested for pollutant removal and micro-invertebrate abundance. In all systems, the VF CW removed mainly organic matter, solids and NH4(+)-N. Pathogens were removed in both compartments. Likewise, total nitrogen removal occurred in both compartments, only the Recirculating HFF was not able to denitrify the nitrogen due to the slightly more oxic conditions as compared to the other systems. All systems met discharge guidelines for organic matter, but only the Control and Aerated systems met those for total nitrogen. At the applied loading rates, the pollutant removal was not significantly enhanced by the use of aeration and recirculation. Therefore, operation as in the Control system, without aeration or recirculation, is recommended for the tested Duplex-CWs. If artificial aeration will be used in CWs, the support material should be carefully selected to allow a proper air distribution.

AB  - To improve nutrient removal, a full-scale hybrid constructed wetland (CW) consisting of pre-treatment units, vertical-baffled flow wetlands (VBFWs), and horizontal subsurface flow wetlands (HSFWs) was installed in August 2014 to treat sewage wastewater. Artificial aeration (AA) was applied continuously in the VBFW stage to improve the aerobic condition in the hybrid CW. Water samples were collected and analyzed twice a month between the period of August 2015 and July 2016. The results suggest that this new hybrid CW can achieve a satisfactory reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) with average removal rates of 85%  10% (35%  19 g/m2 per day), 76%  18% (7%  2 g/m2 per day), 65%  13% (8%  2 g/m2 per day), and 65%  21% (1 g/m2 per day), respectively. AA significantly improved the aerobic condition throughout the experimental period, and the positive influence of AA on nitrogen removal was found to be higher during summer that during winter. A significant positive correlation between water temperature and nutrient removal (p < 0.01) was observed in the system. Overall, this study demonstrates the application of AA in a full-scale hybrid CW with satisfactory nutrient removal rates. The hybrid CW system with artificial aeration can serve as a reference for future applications areas where land availability is limited.

AB  - Determining the fate of emerging organic contaminants in an aquatic ecosystem is important for developing constructed wetlands (CWs) treatment technology. Experiments were carried out in subsurface flow CWs in Singapore to evaluate the fate and transport of eight pharmaceutical compounds. The CW system included three parallel horizontal subsurface flow CWs and three parallel unplanted beds fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The findings of the tests at 2-6 d HRTs showed that the pharmaceuticals could be categorized as (i) efficiently removed compounds with removal higher than 85% (ketoprofen and salicylic acid); (ii) moderately removed compounds with removal efficiencies between 50% and 85% (naproxen, ibuprofen and caffeine); and (iii) poorly removed compounds with efficiency rate lower than 50% (carbamazepine, diclofenac, and clofibric acid). Except for carbamazepine and salicylic acid, removal efficiencies of the selected pharmaceuticals showed significant (p<0.05) enhancement in planted beds as compared to the unplanted beds. Removal of caffeine, ketoprofen and clofibric acid were found to follow first order decay kinetics with decay constants higher in the planted beds than the unplanted beds. Correlations between pharmaceutical removal efficiencies and log K(ow) were not significant (p>0.05), implying that their removal is not well related to the compound's hydrophobicity.

AB  - In this study, a novel aerated surface flow constructed wetland (SFCW) using exhaust gas from biological wastewater treatment was investigated. Compared with un-aerated SFCW, the introduction of exhaust gas into SFCW significantly improved NH4+-N, TN and COD removal efficiencies by 68.30 ± 2.06%, 24.92 ± 1.13% and 73.92 ± 2.36%, respectively. The pollutants removal mechanism was related to the microbial abundance and the highest microbial abundance was observed in the SFCW with exhaust gas because of the introduction of exhaust gas from sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and thereby optimizing nitrogen transformation processes. Moreover, SFCW would significantly mitigate the risk of exhaust gas pollution. SFCW removed 20.00 ± 1.23%, 34.78 ± 1.39%, and 59.50 ± 2.33% of H2S, NH3 and N2O in the exhaust gas, respectively. And 31.32 ± 2.23% and 32.02 ± 2.86% of bacterial and fungal aerosols in exhaust gas were also removed through passing SFCW, respectively.

AB  - Microbial degradation is an important pathway during the removal of pharmaceuticals in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, the effects of CW design, plant presence, and different plant species on the microbial community in CWs have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of l-arginine, l-phenyloalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations. These results provide useful information for optimizing the operational parameters of CWs to improve ibuprofen removal.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the influence of batch versus continuous flow on the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (TP) in tropical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CW). The quantitative role of the higher aquatic plants in nutrient removal in these two operational modes was also investigated. Results indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05) in COD removal between batch and continuous flow modes for either the planted or unplanted treatments. Furthermore, the batch-loaded planted wetlands showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher ammonium removal efficiencies (95.2%) compared with the continuously fed systems (80.4%), most probably because the drain and fill batch mode presented systematically more oxidized environmental conditions. With respect to TP removal, for both planted and unplanted beds, there was significant enhancement (p < 0.05) in batch flow operation (69.6% for planted beds; 39.1% for unplanted beds) as compared to continuous flow operation (46.8% for planted beds; 25.5% for unplanted beds). In addition, at a 4-day hydraulic retention time (HRT), the presence of plants significantly enhanced both ammonia oxidation and TP removal in both batch and continuous modes of operation as compared to that for unplanted beds. An estimation of the quantitative role of aeration from drain and fill operation at a 4-day HRT, as compared to rhizosphere aeration by the higher aquatic plant, indicated that drain and fill operation might account for only less than half of the higher aquatic plant's quantitative contribution of oxygen (1.55 g O2 per m2 per day for batch flow versus 1.13 g O2 per m2 per day for continuous flow).

AB  - Heavy oil-produced water (HOPW) is a by-product during heavy oil exploitation and can cause serious environmental pollution if discharged without adequate treatment. Commercial biochemical treatment units are important parts of HOPW treatment processes, but many are not in stable operation because of the toxic and refractory substances, salt, present. Therefore, pilot-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrolytic acidification-biological filter with airlift aeration (HA-BFAA), a novel HOPW treatment system. Four strains isolated from oily sludge were used for bioaugmentation to enhance the biodegradation of organic pollutants. The isolated bacteria were evaluated using 3-day biochemical oxygen demand, oil, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals as evaluation indices. Bioaugmentation enhanced the COD removal by 43.5 mg/L under a volume load of 0.249 kg COD/m(3) day and hydraulic retention time of 33.6 h. The effluent COD was 70.9 mg/L and the corresponding COD removal was 75.0 %. The optimum volumetric air-to-water ratio was below 10. The removal ratios of the total extractable organic pollutants, alkanes, and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons were 71.1, 94.4, and 94.0 %, respectively. Results demonstrated that HA-BFAA was an excellent HOPW treatment system.

AB  - In this study, a high organic loading rate of 58-146 g BOD5/m2 day with a hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 1.63 m3/m2 day and retention time (RT) of 16 h was achieved to maximize the treatment capacity of a four-stage alum sludge-based constructed wetland (CW) system. An alternative operation strategy, i.e., the first stage anaerobic up-flow and the remaining stage tidal flow with effluent recirculation, was investigated to achieve the goal with good treatment performance of 82% COD, 91% BOD5, 92% SS, 94% NH4-N, and 82% TN removal. Two kinetic models, i.e., first-order model and Monod plus continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) flow model, were employed for predicting the removal dynamics. The results showed that the tidal flow strategy enhances oxygen transport and diffusion, thus improving reduction of organics and NH4-N. Effluent recirculation could further increase elimination of organics by extending the interaction time and also benefit the denitrification process. In addition, denitrification could be further enhanced by anaerobic up-flow in the first stage.

AB  - Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) with and without redox manipulation by front aeration were operated to treat mechanically pretreated wastewater from a nearby wastewater treatment plant. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454-pyrosequencing were used to characterize the shifts in bacterial community diversity and composition in response to front aeration in the HSSF CWs. Both techniques revealed similar bacterial diversity between the HSSF CWs with (ACW) and without front aeration (NACW). Differences in microbial functional groups between the ACW and the NACW substrate samples were identified with 454-pyrosequencing. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas) had much higher abundances in the ACW, whereas more sequences related to sulfate-reducing bacteria and anaerobic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (genera Sulfuricella, Sulfuritalea, and Sulfuricurvum) were detected in the NACW. Removal efficiencies for NH₄(+)-N, PO₄(3-)-P and chemical oxygen demand in the ACW were 48.7 ± 15.5, 70.2 ± 13.5, and 82.0 ± 6.4%, respectively, whereas the removal efficiencies for these parameters in the NACW were 10.3 ± 14.0, 53.1 ± 18.9, and 68.8 ± 10.7%, respectively. In the ACW, the stimulation of nitrification via front aeration supplied more NO₂(-)-N and NO₃(-)-N to the subsequent denitrification process than in the NACW, resulting in higher total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency. The differences in treatment efficiencies between the ACW and the NACW could be partially explained by the different bacterial community compositions in the two CWs.

AB  - The effects of micro-aeration and substrate selection on domestic sewage treatment performance were explored using three pairs (with or without micro-aeration) of horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) constructed wetlands (CWs) filled with zeolite, ceramsite or quartz granules. The individual and combined effects of micro-aeration and substrate selection on the purification performance of the experimental-scale HSSF CWs were evaluated. The results showed that micro-aeration significantly increased the treatment efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (PO4(3-)-P) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) using HSSF CWs, while the substrate selection significantly affected the TP, PO4(3-)-P and NH4+-N removal efficiencies (p<0.05). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was a significant interaction term (i.e. micro-aeration×substrate selection) for NH4+-N removal (p<0.05). Among the three substrates, ceramsite was the best substrate for the treatment of domestic sewage using HSSF CWs. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that a ceramsite-filled HSSF CW with micro-aeration could be the optimal configuration for decentralized domestic sewage treatment.

AB  - Nitrogen removal in vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) is still a key problem especially for treating low C/N wastewaters. In this study, nitrogen removal and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in biochar-amended aerated VFCWs were evaluated under the varying intermittent aeration (different aeration times and aeration rates). The results indicated that the optimal aeration time and rate were 2 h d-1 and 0.6 L min-1, which could create alternant of aerobic and anaerobic conditions for the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in VFCWs. Much higher removal efficiency of COD (95.9%), NH4+-N (96.6%), and TN (74.7%) was achieved under the optimal conditions, and moderate N2O emission (282 μg m-2·h-1) was observed simultaneously. The results can be used to select the optimal aeration in the further design and application of biochar-amended aerated CW treatments.

AB  - Recently, vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with intermittent aeration have been proven as an efficient technology to enhance removal efficiency of organics and nitrogen for wastewater treatment. However, the low denitrification effect in VFCWs was a problem for treating low carbon source wastewater. In this study, intermittent aeration and biochar, produced by biomass pyrolysis, was used to promote the nitrogen removal in VFCWs for low C/N domestic wastewater. Four systems, including non-aerated with non-biochar VFCW, non-aerated with biochar VFCW, aerated with non-biochar VFCW and aerated with biochar VFCW, were conducted for comparing their treatment performances. The results showed that much higher removal of COD (94.9%), NH4+-N (99.1%), TN (52.7%) and lower N2O emission (60.54μg·m-2·h-1) was obtained in aerated VFCW with biochar addition. The results suggested that adding biochar to intermittent aerated VFCWs could be an effective and appropriate strategy for low C/N wastewater treatment.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) are efficient in reducing excessive contamination from wastewaters. However, oxygen inside CW beds is frequently low especially when substrate clogging problems appear after long-term operation, and this may become a limited factor for the treatment of wastewaters. Aimed at dealing with the issue of a low oxygen content in CW systems, two laboratory-scale vertical-flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with and without an aeration device (called VFCW-a and VFCW-c, respectively) were designed in this study to test the contribution of supplementary aeration to the treatment of decentralized domestic wastewater. Results showed that under the intermittent operation of about 45 days, two VFCW units were successfully started up by using activated sludge as seed sludge. Compared to VFCW-c, VFCW-a had a better resistance ability to organic shock loads and its removal function could be effectively recovered within a short period after the introduction of organic shock loads. Under intermittent operation with a 12 h idling time, the ideal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of VFCW-a was 42 h, about 6 h shorter than that of VFCW-c. Likewise, under intermittent operation with 42 h HRT, the ideal idling time of VFCW-a was 12 h, still about 6 h shorter than that of VFCW-c. Under intermittent operation with HRT-42 h and an idling time of 12 h, SS, COD, TN and TP removal efficiencies in VFCW-a could reach 81.2%, 85%, 89.9% and 77.9%, respectively. The VFCW unit with supplementary aeration is an efficient innovation for the treatment of decentralized domestic wastewater.
