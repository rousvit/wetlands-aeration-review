Here, a long term VFCWs study for domestic wastewater treatment was carried out to investigate the impact of intermittent aeration and three construction-waste media (common gravel, red brick and fly-ash brick) on N loss, N retention and microbial community. The total nitrogen (TN) removal was significantly higher in aerated VFCWs (91.31%-93.91%) compared with non-aerated VFCWs (12.22%-53.92%), with the highest removal rate in system VI filled with fly-ash brick. Nitrification/denitrification was the main N sink in aerated VFCWs accounting for 36.79%-55.44%, while media storage (8.47%-48.64%) dominated in non-aerated systems because of nitrification limitation. < 16% of the TN removal was uptake by plants, and N2O emission contributed about 0.08%-0.39%. Microbial study found that functional bacteria increased with intermittently aeration. The analysis revealed the crucial influence of oxygen supply and media on N transformations in VFCWs.

Dynamics of emerging organic contaminant removal in conventional and intensified subsurface flow treatment wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aeration; Constructed wetland; Micropollutant; P-k-C* model; Seasonality; Wastewater	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER ACESULFAME; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; MICROPOLLUTANT REMOVAL; MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR; URBAN WASTEWATERS; TREATMENT SYSTEMS	Six pilot-scale treatment wetlands treating municipal wastewater were monitored for classical wastewater parameters and selected Emerging Organic Compounds (EOCs): caffeine (CAF), ibuprofen (1BU), naproxen (NPX), benzotriazole (BTZ), diclofenac (DCL), acesulfame (ACE) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on a weekly basis over the course of one year. Treatment efficacy of the wetland systems was compared to that of a municipal wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the research site (activated sludge technology). The aerated wetlands VAp and HAp. and the two-stage vertical flow system VGp + VSp showed the highest treatment efficacy (>70% removal on a mass basis) and comparable treatment efficacy to the conventional WWTP for removal of CAF, IBU, NPX, BTZ. and DCL Annual mass removal of ACE in the WWTP was 50% and varied in the wetlands (depending on system design) from zero to 62%. On a mean monthly basis, ACE removal in the treatment wetlands VGp - VSp, VAp center dot HAp, R was high (> 90%) for six months of the year. Monthly mean mass removal of CBZ was negligible for the WWTP and all treatment wetland systems except H50p, which showed up to 49% mass removal in June. Monthly mean mass removals of classical wastewater parameters and readily biodegradable EOCs (represented by CAF, IBU, NPX) were most stable in the intensified wetland designs VAp, HAp, and R. A statistical analysis confirms that system complexity, aerobic conditions, and temperature have the highest correlation to overall pollutant removal in the treatment wetland systems, including EOCs of high to moderate biodegradability. First-order removal rate coefficents and temperature correction factors for EOCs are reported for the first time in the treatment wetland literature. Limitations on the use of these values in engineering design are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lessons learnt from a pilot study on residual dye removal by an aerated treatment wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Constructed wetland; Treatment wetland; Aerated wetland; Dye removal; Textile wastewater; Residual dye	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; ACID ORANGE 7; AZO-DYE; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; TEXTILE EFFLUENTS; DECOLORIZATION; PHYTOREMEDIATION; PERFORMANCE; OZONATION	Treatment wetlands (1Ws) have shown good capacity in dye removal from textile wastewater. However, the high hydraulic retention times (HRTs) required by these solutions and the connected high area requirements, remain a big drawback towards the application of TWs for dye treatment at full scale. Aerated TWs are interesting intensified solutions that attempt to reduce the TW required area. Therefore, an aerated CW pilot plant, composed of a 20 m(2) horizontal subsurface flow TW (HF) and a 21 m(2) Free Water System (FWS), equipped with aeration pipelines, was built and monitored to investigate the potential reduction of required area for dye removal from the effluent wastewater of a centralized wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). During a 8 months long study, experimenting with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs - 1.2, 2.6 and 3.5 days) and aeration modes (intermittent and continuous), the pilot plant has shown a normal biological degradation for organic matter and nutrients, while the residual dye removal has been very low, as demonstrated by the absorbance measure at three wavelengths: at 426 nm (blue) the removal varies from -55% at influent absorbance of 0.010 to 41% at 0.060; at 558 nm (yellow) the removal is negative at 0.005 (-58%) and high at higher influent concentrations (72% at 0.035 of absorbance for the inlet); at 660 nm (red) -82% of removal efficiency was obtained at influent absorbance of 0.002 and 74% at 0.010. These results are a consequence of the biological oxidation processes taking place in the WWTP, so that the residual dye seems to be resistant to further aerobic degradation. Therefore, TWs enhanced by aeration can provide only a buffer effect on peak dye concentrations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Turker, OC				Turker, Onur Can			Simultaneous boron (B) removal and electricity generation from domestic wastewater using duckweed-based wastewater treatment reactors coupled with microbial fuel cell	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water treatment; Duckweed wastewater treatment systems; Microbial fuel cell; Boron removal; Electricity generation	LEMNA-GIBBA L.; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; TOXICITY ASSESSMENT; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; PLANTS; TECHNOLOGY; ECOSYSTEMS; SYSTEM; MEDIA; MODEL	Boron removal from water environment is a critical issue for scientific spotlight because its removal from wastewater is difficult and costly with conventional treatment method. Herein, an innovative, cost effective and attractive method which depends on duckweed-based wastewater treatment systems coupled with microbial fuel cell reactor (DWWT-MFC) was investigated for B-polluted domestic wastewater treatment and simultaneous electricity generation for the first time in an eco-technological study. Lemma gibba L. was selected as a model duckweed species, and different reactors were also designed to identify which mechanisms are dominant for B removal in a DWWT-MFC reactor matrix. DWWT-MFC reactor achieved 71% B removal in experiment period, and the plant effect on B removal mechanisms in the reactor matrix was recorded as 37.7 +/- 4.92% (F = 2.543, p < 0.05). However, supplementary aeration and microbial effects on B removal were determined as negligible. Average maximum voltage output was found as 1.47 V, and maximum power density was 34.8 mW/m(2) at a current density of 43.9 mA/m(2) with supplementary aeration. Moreover, DWWT-MFC reactor achieved 84%, 81% and 76% of COD, NH(4)(+ )and PO43- removal efficiencies, respectively. Moreover, L. gibba grew well in the anode chamber of DWWT-MFC with an average biomass yield of 218 +/- 43 g/m(2) and a total chlorophyll (a + b) concentration of 30.2 mg g(-1), which indicates that anolyte environment was not toxic for L. gibba growth. Consequently, it can be suggested that environmental experts may use DWWT-MFC as an efficient removal method to treat B from domestic wastewater and to produce bioelectricity.

This study explored the wastewater treatment performance of multi-soil-layering (MSL) systems through interactive factorial analysis. MSL systems showed good performances under various operating conditions. The COD and BOD5 removal rates in MSL systems could reach 98.53 and 93.66%, respectively. The performances of MSL systems in TP removal stayed at high levels ranged from 97.97 to 100% throughout the experiments. The NH4+ - N removal rates of the well performed MSL systems reached highest levels ranging from 89.96 to 100%. The TN removal rates of aerated MSL systems ranged from 51.11 to 64.44% after 72 days of operation. The independent effects of bottom submersion, microbial amendment and aeration, as well as most interactions were significant. The performance of MSL systems was mainly affected by bottom submersion and aeration as well as their interactions. Aeration was the most positive factor for the removal of organic matter, TP and NH4+ - N. However, oxygenated environment was unfavorable for NO3- - N removal. In the submerged area with limited oxygen, the microbial transformation of NO3- - N still occurred. A stepwise-cluster inference model was developed for tackling the multivariate nonlinear relationships in contaminant removal processes. The results can help obtain a better understanding of the complicated processes among contaminant removal in MSL systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Laboratory scale experiments targeting N losses via denitrification in sediments colonized by emergent macrophytes require the use of mesocosms that are necessarily open to the atmosphere. Thus, the proper quantification of N-2 effluxes relies on the accurate characterization of the air-water gas exchanges. In this study, we present a simple approach for direct measurements of the gas transfer velocity, in open-top mesocosms with Phragmites australis, by using argon as a tracer. Different conditions of water velocity (0, 1.5, 3, and 6 cm s(-1)) and temperature (8.5, 16, and 28 degrees C), were tested, along with, for the first time, the presence of emergent vegetation. The outcomes demonstrated that water velocity and temperature are not the only factors regulating aeration at the mesocosm scale. Indeed, the gas transfer velocity was systematically higher, in the range of 42-53%, in vegetated compared to unvegetated sediments. The increase of small-local turbulence patterns created within water parcels moving around plant stems translated into significant modifications of the reaeration process. The adopted approach may be used to improve the accuracy of denitrification measurements by N-2 efflux-based methods in wetland and slow-flow waterway sediments colonized by emergent macrophytes. Moreover, the present outcomes may have multiple implications for whole system metabolism estimations from which largely depend our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in inland waters that have strong connections to worldwide issues, such as nitrate contamination and greenhouse gas emissions.

Within MSL system, the environmental cleanup capability of soil is maximized, while the soil microbial communities may also change during operation. This study aimed to reveal the nature of biophysiological changes in MSL systems during operation. The species diversity in soil mixture blocks was analyzed using Illumina HiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The interactive effects of operating factors on species richness, community diversity and bacteria abundance correlated with COD, N and P removal were revealed through factorial analysis. The results indicated the main factors, aeration, bottom submersion and microbial amendment, had different significant effects on microbial responses. The surface area and porosity of zeolites in permeable layers decreased due to the absorption of extracellular polymeric substances. The findings were applied for the design and building of a full-size MSL system in field and satisfied removal efficiency was achieved. The results of this study can help better understand the mechanisms of pollutant reduction within MSL systems from microbial insights. It will have important implications for developing appropriate strategies for operating MSL systems with high efficiency and less risks.

However, the nitrogen removal in conventional CW is usually limited by the low dissolved oxygen (DO) and insufficient electron donor. This paper investigated the nitrogen removal performance and mechanisms in the poly (butylenes succinate)-based CW (PBS-CW) while treating ammonia wastewater under different DO levels. The average DO contents in limited-aeration and full-aeration phases were 1.68 mgL(-1) and 5.71 mgL(-1), respectively. Results indicated that, with the ammonia nitrogen loading rate of 25 g N m(-3) day(-1), total nitrogen removal ratios in the PBS-CW under the limited-aeration and full-aeration phases were 72% and 99%, respectively. Combined analyses revealed that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) via nitrite/nitrate were the main microbial nitrogen removal pathways in the aeration phase of the PBS-CW (>89%). The microbial carrier of biodegradable material was believed to play a significant role in prompting SND performance while dealing with low C/N wastewater. Due to the coexistence of micro-anaerobic zone and carbon supply inside the coated biofilm, the high DO level in the PBS-CW increased the abundance of the nitrifying bacteria (amoA and nxrA), denitrifying bacteria (narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ), and even anammox bacteria (anammox 16s rRNA). These features are beneficial to many microbial processes which require the simultaneous aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic environment.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Surface organic loading; Aeration mode; Functional genes; N2O; Nitrogen	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; INTERMITTENT AERATION; POLLUTANTS REMOVAL; RATIOS; OPERATION; GENES; RATES	This study evaluated the influence of influent surface organic loading (SOL) and aeration mode on nitrogen removal and N2O emission in subsurface wastewater infiltration systems (SWISs). Aeration developed appropriate oxygen conditions, which resulted in high COD, NH4+-N and TN removal and enhanced the abundances of amoA, nxrA, napA, narG, nirS, nirK, qnorB and nosZ under SOL rate of 21.2 and 33.8 g COD/(m(2)d) compared to the non-aerated SWIS. N2O emission decreased with influent SOL rate increasing in non-aerated and aerated SWISs. The SWIS with intermittent aeration had a better performance on TN removal and lower N2O emission compared to the SWIS with continuous aeration under the same SOL rate. It could conclude that intermittent aeration is a feasible method to win high influent SOL rate, high TN removal and low N2O emission for SWISs.

Aeration and plant coverage influence floating treatment wetland remediation efficacy	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Phosphorus; Nitrification; Denitrification; Canna flaccida; Juncus effusus	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; WATER TREATMENT PLANTS; WASTE-WATER; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; REMOVAL PERFORMANCE; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; NITRATE REMOVAL; COD/N RATIOS; PHOSPHORUS	Nutrient contamination of waterways is a growing concern, instigating the emergence of floating treatment wetland systems (FTWs) to remove nutrients from water. To determine if aeration of water systems enhances nutrient removal efficacy or nutrient fixation within plant tissues, aeration in combination with FTW installation techniques were investigated. During two separate trials with Juncus effusus and Canna flaccida, treatments consisted of either aerated or non-aerated mesocosms, with varying coverage and planting density combinations. Aeration increased the dissolved oxygen levels within each mesocosm, but reduced the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from the water column in comparison to non-aerated systems. Plant samples collected from 100% planting density treatments that were aerated had a greater nitrogen uptake than non-aerated by as much as 55% or 13.5 g/m 2 at harvest. Some discrepancies between plant uptake and water column nutrient levels can be attributed to microbially-mediated nitrogen losses (e.g., denitrification).	[Chance, Lauren M.

Furthermore, the additional aim was to identify the transformation products of DCF and SMX along the flow path of the treatment system. This two-stage system was fed for 442 days with an artificial municipal wastewater containing DCF and SMX at a concentration of 2 mg/L each. The removal of SMX in the CW-1 was found to be significantly higher under non-aerated conditions ( > 77%) as compared to aerated conditions (26%), but the aeration of the CW-2 was insignificant for the SMX removal. In contrast, the removal of DCF was not affected by aeration in the CW-1 (removal efficiency of approximately 50%), but was significantly positively influenced by the combined effect of plants and aeration in the CW-2. The overall removal of SMX and DCF in the two-stage system was 95.8% and 77.6%, respectively. The transformation products of SMX and DCF detected in the studied system indicated the potential contribution of both oxic and anoxic transformation pathways, potentially including also abiotic reaction between SMX and Fe(II) leading to the cleavage of the isoxazole ring in this compound. Some of the transformation products found in the CW-1 were not further detected in the CW-2. Based on the literature data the antimicrobial activity and potential activity of the identified transformation products cannot be ruled out. Giant miscanthus growing in the CW-1 was unaffected by the high concentrations of DCF and SMX in contrast to the emergent macrophytes (on the floating island) or the free-floating plants present in the CW-2, which failed to adapt to the presence of the pharmaceuticals. As a result, the CW-2 was colonized by an unidentified species of a water moss and algae.

A lab-scale SFCW was operated under a cold temperature (below 10 degrees C) in this study to investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of organics and nitrogen removal from secondary effluent. The obtained results indicated that the distinct spatial-temporal variation of organics and nitrogen was observed in the experimental SFCW under the cold temperature. Organics degradation primarily occurred in the surface water and water-sediment-plant interface, while nitrogen removal was mainly accomplished in the water-sediment-plant interface. Cold temperature had much more important effect on the TN removal. Based on the degradation model, organics and NH4+-N could be degraded significantly in a short time because of the appropriate oxygen level, but the TN removal might be hindered due to the limited carbon supply for denitrification in a longer time. The obtained findings would contribute to a better understanding of organics and nitrogen biodegradation processes in SFCWs treating low carbon wastewaters in low-temperatures regions.

Vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands for the removal of petroleum contaminants from secondary refinery effluent at the Kaduna refining plant (Kaduna, Nigeria)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Petroleum pollutants; Secondary refinery effluent; Treatment performance; Bioaccumulation; Translocation	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; PILOT-SCALE; OIL; PHYTOREMEDIATION; PERFORMANCES; ACCUMULATION; HYDROCARBONS; VEGETATION; AERATION; SYSTEMS	Typha latifolia-planted vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (VSSF CWs) and an unplanted microcosm constructed wetland were used for treating secondary refinery wastewater from the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company (KRPC, Nigeria). Cow dung was applied to the planted wetlands at the start of the experiment and after 3months to enhance plant growth and petroleum degradation. The T. latifolia-planted VSSF CWs removed 45-99% total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), 99-100% phenol, 70-80% oil and grease, 45-91% chemical oxygen demand (COD), and 46-88% total suspended solids (TSSs). The performance of the unplanted control VSSF CW achieved lower removal efficiencies (15-58% TPH, 86-91% phenol, 16-44% oil and grease, 24-66% COD, and 20-55% TSS). T. latifolia plants had a bioaccumulation factor (BAF) >1 for phenol, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP), suggesting a high removal performance for these contaminants and good translocation ability (TF) for TPH, phenol, oil and grease, and TN, with the exception of TP which was mainly retained in their roots (BAF=47). This study showed T. latifolia is a good candidate plant to be used in VSSF CWs for polishing secondary refinery wastewater in developing countries.

J	Higgins, D; Curtin, T; Burke, I; Courtney, R				Higgins, Derek; Curtin, Teresa; Burke, Ian; Courtney, Ronan			The potential for constructed wetland mechanisms to treat alkaline bauxite residue leachate: carbonation and precipitate characterisation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Alkaline drainage; Bauxite residue; Constructed wetlands; Neutralisation; Carbonation	RED MUD; FILTER MEDIA; NEUTRALIZATION; ALUMINUM; REMOVAL; TRANSFORMATION; ADSORPTION; CONVERSION; SEAWATER; DRAINAGE	Leachates emanating from bauxite residue disposal areas are alkaline and require neutralisation prior to discharge. The use of passive technologies such as constructed wetlands has received increasing interest as possible treatments for alkaline leachates, including bauxite residues. Mechanisms proposed for wetland effectiveness have included calcite precipitation but it is not clear if such a pathway is feasible in the relatively low Ca residue leachates. Carbonation of Ca-spiked residue leachate treatments was conducted to observe rates of pH decrease and precipitate formation. For all treatments, carbonation effectively decreased pH to ca. 10.5 which remained stable following aeration. Decreases in Al content of 83-93% were also observed. Precipitates retrieved from carbonation experiments and from a constructed wetland trial were characterised using XRD, SEM, XPS and EDX. Calcium carbonates formed in Ca-spiked treatments and dawsonite precipitation occur in the absence of Ca. Rinsing of precipitates removes surface calcium indicating soluble forms adsorbed on precipitates. The results demonstrate that carbonation of bauxite residue leachate is an important component of passive treatments and neutralisation.

For this purpose, we performed an experiment during 113 days in which we treated a fishpond effluent using four different CWs: (i) with the free-floating macrophyte Eichhornia crassipes (Ec); (ii) without E. crassipes (WEc); (iii) with a substrate and the emergent macrophyte Typha domingensis (Td); (iv) with a substrate and without T. domingensis (WTd). To verify the efficiency of CWs, the removal rates of total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved (DKN) and total (TKN) Kjeldahl nitrogen, total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), total phosphorus (TP) and Porthophosphate (P-ORT) were analysed using ANOVA-rm. The removal of TP and TKN was higher in CWs with substrate than without substrate. The removal of PORT, TIN and DKN was higher in Ec compared to others CWs. The average removal of TSS in Ec (78.9%), WTd (77.4%) and Td (75.0%) was higher than in WEc (68.3%). The contribution of E. crassipes towards the removal of all forms of N and P was higher than of T. domingensis. This greater contribution of E. crassipes can be due to the higher biomass that this species gained in comparison with T. domingensis.	[Osti, Joao A. S.; Henares, Matheus N. P.; Camargo, Antonio F.

The decolourisation efficiencies were up to 91% for 500 mg/L of Acid Red 18 (AR18). However, the power density declined with the increment in azo dye concentration. The results suggest that the combination of salinity and aeration at an optimum level improved the power performance. The highest power density achieved was 8.67 mW/m(2). The increase of nitrate by 3-fold led to decrease in decolourisation and power density of the system. The findings revealed that the electron acceptors (AR18, nitrate and anode) competed at the anodic region for electrons and the electron transfer pathways would directly influence the treatment and power performance of UFCW-MFC. The planted UFCW-MFC significantly outweighed the plant-free control in power performance.

Pika burrow and control sites without disturbance by pika were selected to measure the soil water content, bulk density, soil organic matter (SOM), NH4-N content and NO3-N content in August 2012. N2O fluxes were measured with static opaque chambers at these sites in June and August 2012. Pika burrowing altered soil aeration by transferring deeper soil to the surface and by constructing underground burrows, which significantly increased bulk density, and reduced soil water content, SOM and NH4-N content at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm soil depth. N2O flux had a significant correlation with bulk density, SOM and NH4-N content. Pika burrowing significantly influenced N2O flux by increasing N2O flux at the control site from near zero to 0.063 +/- 0.011 mg m(-2) h(-1). Our findings described how pika burrowing influences the soil traits and significantly increases the principal greenhouse gas N2O emission. As plateau pika was commonly considered as a pest, our findings give a novel clue to effectively manage populations of plateau pika on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from the perspective of greenhouse gas emission.

Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process was observed with 90.4% NH4+-N and 92.1% TN removal efficiencies. Nitrification and denitrification genes were both preferentially enriched on the surface of PHBV. Nitrogen transformation along the flow direction showed that NH4+-N was oxidized to NO3--N at the lowermost 10 cm of the substrate and NO3--N gradually degraded over the depth. AmoA gene was more enriched at -10 and -50 cm layers. NirS gene was the dominant functional gene at the bottom layer with the abundance of 2.05 x 10(7) copies g(-1) substrate while nosZ gene was predominantly abundant with 7.51 x 10(6) and 2.64 x 10(6) copies g(-1) substrate at the middle and top layer, respectively, indicating that functional division of dominant nitrogen functional genes forms along the flow direction in AC-VFCW.

J	Wei, CJ; Wu, WZ				Wei, Cai-jie; Wu, Wei-zhong			Performance of single-pass and by-pass multi-step multi-soil-layering systems for low-(C/N)-ratio polluted river water treatment	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Multi-step multi-soil-layering; Nitrogen removal; Step-feeding; Carbon-nitrogen ratios; Biofilm	HYBRID CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER; NITROGEN REMOVAL; CARBON SOURCE; MECHANISMS	Two kinds of hybrid two-step multi-soil-layering (MSL) systems loaded with different filter medias (zeolite-ceramsite MSL-1 and ceramsite-red clay MSL-2) were set-up for the low-(C/N)-ratio polluted river water treatment. A long-term pollutant removal performance of these two kinds of MSL systems was evaluated for 214 days. By-pass was employed in MSL systems to evaluate its effect on nitrogen removal enhancement. Zeolite-ceramsite single-pass MSL-1 system owns outstanding ammonia removal capability (24 g NH4+-Nm(-2)d(-1)), 3 times higher than MSL-2 without zeolite under low aeration rate condition (0.8 x 10(4) L m(-2).h(-1)). Aeration rate up to 1.6 x 10(4) L m(-2).h(-1) well satisfied the requirement of complete nitrification in first unit of both two MSLs. However, weak denitrification in second unit was commonly observed. By-pass of 50% influent into second unit can improve about 20% TN removal rate for both MSL-1 and MSL-2. Complete nitrification and denitrification was achieved in by-pass MSL systems after addition of carbon source with the resulting C/N ratio up to 2.5. The characters of biofilms distributed in different sections inside MSL-1 system well illustrated the nitrogen removal mechanism inside MSL systems. Two kinds of MSLs are both promising as an appealing nitrifying biofilm reactor. Recirculation can be considered further for by-pass MSL-2 system to ensure a complete ammonia removal.

An intermittent micro-aeration control system was used to control methane emissions from an integrated vertical-flow constructed wetland (IVCW) to treat agricultural domestic wastewater pollution in this study. The optimized intermittent micro-aeration conditions were a 20-min aeration time and 340-min non-aeration time, 3.9 m(3) h(-1) aeration intensity, evenly distributed micro-aeration diffusers at the tank bottom, and an aeration period of every 6 h. Methane flux emission by intermittent micro-aeration was decreased by 60.7% under the optimized conditions. The average oxygen transfer efficiency was 26.73%. The control of CH4 emission from IVCWs was most strongly influenced by the intermittent micro-aeration diffuser distribution, followed by aeration intensity, aeration time, and water depth. Scaling up of IVCWs is feasible in rural areas by using intermittent micro-aeration control as a mitigation measure for methane gas emissions for climate change.

In this study, nitrogen removal and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in biochar-amended aerated VFCWs were evaluated under the varying intermittent aeration (different aeration times and aeration rates). The results indicated that the optimal aeration time and rate were 2 h d(-1) and 0.6 L min(-1), which could create alternant of aerobic and anaerobic conditions for the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in VFCWs. Much higher removal efficiency of COD (95.9%), NH4+-N (96.6%), and TN (74.7%) was achieved under the optimal conditions, and moderate N2O emission (282 mu gm(-2).h(-1)) was observed simultaneously. The results can be used to select the optimal aeration in the further design and application of biochar-amended aerated CW treatments.

The common reed (Phragmites australis) is the most commonly used plant species in CWs and frequently displays Fe-deficiency symptoms particularly in new-established systems. The aim of this study was therefore to study the Fe-nutrition of P. australis in order to gain knowledge on how Fe-deficiency in P. australis can be alleviated. For this purpose, we grew two genetically distinct phylogeographic groups of P. australis hydroponically with seven different Fe concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 20.0 mg Fe-EDDHA ([iron (3+) ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid]) L-1) in a phytotron. Both groups responded strongly to the increasing Fe supply. The belowground biomass allocation ratio, light-saturated photosynthesis rates, chlorophyll content and leaf Fe tissue concentration all significantly increased with increasing Fe availability. Phragmites australis in the 0 mg FeEDDHA L-1 treatment suffered strongly from Fe deficiency, and plants in the high 20.0 mg Fe-EDDHA L-1 treatment also had reduced growth and Fe toxicity symptoms. The 'critical deficiency concentration' of Fe in leaves of juvenile P. australis was 40-50 mg kg(-1) DM, and the 'critical toxicity concentration' of Fe in leaves of juvenile P. australis were approximately 150 mg kg(-1) DM. Overall the two genetically distinct P. australis groups differed in their ecophysiological traits, and the two groups also responded differently to the different Fe-supply rates which may be the result of adaptations obtained in their native growth habitats. We suggest that the Fe-deficiency in CW systems with unsaturated vertical flow and/or forced aeration can be alleviated by application of a foliar spray containing chelated iron. However, the application rate and frequency should be further studied.

Organic matters and nitrogen removal were evaluated and the denitrifying bacteria community structure was analyzed by MiSeq sequencing technology. Results showed that the TOC removal rates were steadily above 81.6% and the NH4+-N removal rates were 92.1% +/- 0.5% when the pulse aerated activated sludge reactor was operated with the optimized pulse aeration cycle (PAC) of 5/10 min. There was no significant impact on both TOC and NH4+-N removal efficiencies, while the average TN removal rate of the pulse aerated reactor (58.4%) was significantly higher than that of the constantly aerated one (30.6%). The removal efficiencies of both organics and nitrogen were stable during the 60-day acclimation period regardless of the changing DO concentration fluctuated in pulse mode. Although the denitrifier bacterial compositions varied between the pulse aerated group and the constantly aerated group, the denitrifier community richness and diversity were similar. Boost of the TN removal was mainly due to the anoxic denitrifying environment provided by the non-aerated phase in each PAC. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Aerobic conditions were produced at a depth of 50 cm and anoxic or anaerobic conditions were not changed at depths of 80 and 110 cm by aeration in SWIS C. High average removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (83.1% for SWIS B, 90.9% for SWIS C), NH3-N (74.3% for SWIS B, 90.8% for SWIS C) and total nitrogen (TN) (61.1% for SWIS B, 87.9% for SWIS C) were obtained under shunt ratios of 1:3 and 1:2 for SWIS B and C, respectively. The lowest N2O emission rate (28.4 mg/(m(2) d)) and highest nitrogen removal functional gene abundances were achieved in SWIS C under a 1:2 shunt ratio. The results suggested intermittent aeration and shunt distributing wastewater combined strategy would enhance nitrogen removal and reduce N2O emission for SWISs.

Nitrogen removal and N2O emission were affected by influent COD/N ratio. Under a COD/N ratio between 1:1 and 15:1, average chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N and total nitrogen (TN) removal rates decreased with COD/N ratio increase in non-aerated SWISs amended with/without biocharsludge; an increasing COD/N ratio hardly affected COD and NH4+-N removal in a biochar-sludge amended SWIS with intermittent aeration; the N2O emission rate decreased with COD/N ratio increase in the studied SWISs. The biochar-sludge amended SWIS with intermittent aeration achieved high COD (92.2%), NH4+-N (96.8%), and TN (92.7%) removal rates and a low N2O emission rate (10.6 mg/(m(2)d)) under a COD/N ratio of 15:1, which was higher than those in non-aerated SWISs amended with/without biochar-sludge. Combining the biochar-sludge amended SWIS with intermittent aeration enhanced the number of nitrifying bacteria, denitrifying bacteria, nitrate reductase activities, nitrite reductase activities, and improved the abundance of nitrogen removal functional genes under a high influent COD/N ratio. The results suggested that the joint use of intermittent aeration and biochar-sludge in a SWIS could be an effective and appropriate strategy for improving nitrogen removal and reducing N2O emissions in treating high COD/N ratio wastewater.

Removal efficiencies of 67.02%, 89.80%, 90.31% and 75.38% were achieved by the system for chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively. The VF showed much higher average loading rates of COD, TP, NH4+-N and TN (7.96 g/m(2)/d, 0.076 g/m(2)/d, 0.31 g/m(2)/d and 0.99 g/m(2)/d) than in HF (0.65 g/m(2)/d, 0.016 g/m(2)/d, 0.25 g/m(2)/d and 0.50 g/m(2)/d), during the stable operation period. Biodegradation played a major role in pollutant removal, especially for COD and TN. The results of bacterial community analysis indicated that heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (Hydrogenophaga and Flavobacterium) were the dominant contributors for nitrogen removal in the VF, while heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria (Rhodobacter, Flavobacterium and Dechloromonas) and the autotrophic denitrifying bacteria Sulfurimonas played the principal roles for nitrogen removal in the HF. Redundancy analyses showed that COD and NH4+-N were the important factors affecting the distribution of nitrogen removal bacteria in the VF, while pH, dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential were the key factors influencing the distribution of nitrogen removal bacteria in the HF.

An on-line solid-phase extraction combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-UHPLC-MS/MS) was used as extraction, pre-concentration and detection method. In the samples studied, three oestrogens (17 beta-estradiol, estrone and estriol), two androgens (boldenone and testosterone), three progestogens (norgestrel, progesterone and norethisterone) and one glucocorticoid (prednisone) were detected. The removal of hormones was studied in primary and secondary constructed wetland mesocosms. The porous media of the primary constructed wetlands were palm tree mulch. These reactors were used to study the effect of water flow, i.e. horizontal (HF1) vs vertical (VF1). The latter was more efficient in the removal of 17 beta-estradiol (HF1: 30%, VF1: 50%), estrone (HF1: 63%, VF1: 85%), estriol (100% both), testosterone (HF1: 45%, VF1: 73%), boldenone (HF1:-77%, VF1: 100%) and progesterone (HF1: 84%, VF1: 99%). The effluent of HF1 was used as influent of three secondary constructed wetland mesocosms: two double-stage vertical flow constructed wetlands, one with gravel (VF2gravel) and one with palm mulch (VF2mulch), and a mineral-based, horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFmineral). VF2mulch was the most efficient of the secondary reactors, since it achieved the complete removal of the hormones studied with the exception of 17-estradiol. The significantly better removal of BOD and ammonia attained by VF2mulch suggests that the better aeration of mulch favoured the more efficient removal of hormones.

In addition, the zeolite's phosphate adsorption characteristics were evaluated. For this, Two mesocosm SSF TWs were installed and operated during 504 d for the PO4-3-P adsorption from sewage: a) mesocosm SSF TW with natural zeolite (MTW-Z1) and b) mesocosm SSF TW with gravel (MTW-G1). Two ORPs was used in MTW-Z1 and MTW-G1: a) ORP-A, ORP > +50 mV, b) ORP-B, ORP < -50 mV. Furthermore, the adsorption characteristics were evaluated in batch assays (zeolite amount and particle size were studied) with different PO4-3-P initial concentrations. Regarding the mesocosm SSF TWs evaluation, the PO4-3-P removed from sewage by MTW-Z1 is between 20% and 50% significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the MTW-G1. At the same time, ORP-A, above + 50 mV, significantly improves (p < 0.05), by 10% more, the PO4-3-P removal capacity from sewage. Regarding adsorption characteristics, maximum adsorption capacity determined by Langmuir kinetic was 0.03 mg PO4-3-P g(-1) for initial concentrations of 10-15 mg PO4-3-P L-1. In the case of MTW-Z1 with ORPs A (> + 50 mV) and B (< - 50 mV), the zeolite maximum adsorption capacity was 0.3 mg PO4-3-P g(-1). Therefore, the potential maximum adsorption capacity of natural zeolite used as a medium in SSF TWs with ORP conditions below -50 mV and above +50 mV can be increased until 10-fold regarding Langmuir adsorption kinetic.

Two MSL reactors were built and operated under laboratory conditions: a standard and modified MSL design (S-MSL and M-MSL). A tracer test using KCl indicated varying degrees of dispersion, short-circuiting, dead space, effective volume ratio and hydraulic efficiency in two MSL reactors. The new MSL design was found to be most effective in improving hydrodynamic flow conditions. The M-MSL reactor increased the mean HRT from 15.79 to 22.07 h, and decreased the dead space rate from 38% to 8%. The early arrival of the distribution peak, indicator of short-circuiting, was mainly noted in the case of S-MSL RTD which is around 57% of the nominal HRT. A high dead space rate was found to occur in the S-MSL reactor, and produced a poor hydraulic performance. The large difference between the nominal and mean HRT confirms the presence of zones of stagnation in the S-MSL system. The new MSL design increased the effective volume ratio from 0.62 to 0.92. The hydraulic efficiency was increased from 0.26 to 0.84 and reached a good level (lambda. >= 0.75) highlighting the excellent hydraulic performance of the M-MSL design. Obtained results revealed that M-MSL had an optimal hydraulic profile and enhanced sanitary and physicochemical performances compared to S-MSL. The mean log reduction of total coliforms, fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci was increased from 1.25, 1.26 and 1.15 log units for the S-MSL to 2.36, 2.38 and 2.11 log units for the M-MSL reactor. Both MSL reactors achieved high and satisfactory TSS and organics removal. The M-MSL reactor accomplished a 92% removal of TN, while the S-MSL achieved a slightly less effective result. The M-MSL reactor was also found to be more efficient in reducing TP by 98% compared to a removal rate of 76% in the S-MSL reactor. Therefore, the new design of MSL eco-technology could be adopted as an alternative to the current design for efficient domestic wastewater treatment.

New approaches to enhance pollutant removal in artificially aerated wastewater treatment systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aerated constructed wetlands; De-icer contaminated runoff; Phased artificial aeration; Oxygen transfer efficiency; Organic pollutants; Freshwater ecosystems	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; HYDRAULIC LOADING RATES; AIRPORT RUNOFF WATERS; OXYGEN-TRANSFER; INTERMITTENT AERATION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; EFFICIENCY; SCALE; PERFORMANCE	Freshwater ecosystems sustain human society through the provision of a range of services. However, the status of these ecosystems is threatened by a multitude of pressures, including point sources of wastewater. Future treatment of wastewater will increasingly require new forms of decentralised infrastructure. The research reported here sought to enhance pollutant removal within a novel wastewater treatment technology, based on unplanted, artificially aerated, horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The potential for these systems to treat de-icer contaminated runoff from airports, a source of wastewater that is likely to grow in importance alongside the expansion of air travel and under future climate scenarios, was evaluated. A new configuration for the delivery of air to aerated treatment systems was developed and tested, based on a phased-aeration approach. This new aeration approach significantly improved pollutant removal efficiency compared to alternative aeration configurations, achieving <90% removal of influent load for COD, BOD5 and TOC. Optimised operating conditions under phased aeration were also determined. Based on a hydraulic retention time of 1.5 d and a pollutant mass loading rate of 0.10 kg d(-1) m(-2) BOD5, <95% BOD5 removal, alongside final effluent BOD5 concentrations <21 mg L-1, could be achieved from an influent characterised by a BOD5 concentration <800 mg L-1. Key controls on oxygen transfer efficiency within the aerated treatment system were also determined, revealing that standard oxygen transfer efficiency was inversely related to aeration rate between 1 L and 3 L min(-1) and positively related to bed media depth between 1500 mm and 3000 mm. The research reported here highlights the potential for optimisation and subsequent widespread application of the aerated wetland technology, in order to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems and the services that they provide to human society.

Knowledge of the oxygen in the rhizosphere is of primary importance in understanding the function and regulation of microbial communities and macrophytes. Numerous studies on radial oxygen loss (ROL) have greatly elucidated the mechanism of contaminant removal in CWs. The main sources of oxygen in CWs are atmospheric reoxygenation, macrophyte transmission, and artificial aeration. However, artificial aeration is very expensive, and atmospheric reoxygenation is limited. Therefore, ROL by macrophytes is an essential and economical approach for oxygen input in CWs. In this review, we attempted to study the role of macrophytes in CWs. We described the mechanism of ROL and summarized the methods for determining ROL.

The results showed that a simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) process was established in the intermittent aerated V1. While nitrogen removal pathway gradually changed from partial nitrification-denitrification to complete nitrification-denitrification along with reducing COD/N ratio in the continuous limited aerated V2. Effective inhibition of NOBs under intermittent aeration conditions, good retention of anammox bacteria biomass and much faster depletion of COD prior to substantial NH4+-N conversion jointly led to the successful achievement of stable SNDA process with elevated influent COD/N ratios in V1. Furthermore, the presence of SNAD ensured a robust ammonium (84-92%) and TN (80-91%) removal efficiency in V1 under varying COD loading rates. In contrast, the TN removal efficiency decreased rapidly along with the reducing influent COD/N ratios in V2.

The hazardous effect of DWTR metals on the environment is shown to be limited; however, DWTR may release excessive nitrogen and organic matter, hindering recycling in the aquatic environment. To eliminate any potential unfavorable effect, self-purification via intermittent aeration incubation for DWTRs was developed. Results indicated that after approximately 5-6 months of incubation, the easily released nitrogen and organic matter in the DWTRs were mostly removed. The removed nitrogen was found to mainly consist of ammonium nitrogen from inorganic and organic nitrogen groups in the DWTRs. The removed organic matter consisted mainly of humic-like substances associated with the carboxyl group, distributed on the surface of the DWTRs. Biological mechanisms for effective nitrogen and organic matter removal were further explored based on the analysis of bacterial community structure, which indicated that the dominant bacteria genera (e.g., Geothrix, Methylotenem, and Geobacter) in the DWTRs after incubation were closely related to nitrogen and carbon cycles. In addition, the phosphorus adsorption of the DWTRs after incubation was maintained, and the specific surface area, total pore volume, microporosity, and mesoporosity of the DWTRs after incubation tended to increase because of organic matter removal. Accordingly, intermittent aeration not only addressed the concerns caused by potential excessive release of nutrients from DWTRs but also enhanced the favorable effect of DWTRs on biogeochemical cycles. Self-purification can potentially promote the beneficial recycling of DWTRs in the aquatic environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A promising nitrogen removal performance (up to 91%) was observed in CWs coupled with intensified configurations, i.e., aeration and effluent recirculation. The results clearly supported that the higher aeration ratio and presence of effluent recirculation are important to improve the alkalinity and pollutant removal in CWs. The influent pH (>10) was significantly decreased to 8.2-8.8 under the volumetric hydraulic loading rates of 0.105 and 0.21 d(-1) in the CWs. Simultaneously, up to 91% of NH4+-N removal was achieved under the operation of a higher aeration ratio and effluent recirculation. Biological nitrogen transformations accounted for 94% of the consumption of alkalinity in the CWs. The significant enrichment of delta N-15-NH4+ in the effluent (47-58%o) strongly supports the occurrence of microbial transformations for NH4+-N removal. However, relatively lower enrichment factors of delta N-15-NH4+ (-1.8 parts per thousand to -11.6 parts per thousand) compared to the values reported in previous studies reflected the inhibition effect of the high pH alkaline environment on nitrifiers in these CWs.

We used two types of CWs, surface flow (SF) and subsurface flow (SSF), and two plant densities, high density HD (32 plants m(-2)) and low density LD (16 plants m(-2)). We also compared CH4 and N2O emissions in zones planted with macrophytes (Typha sp and Cyperus papyrus) versus zones planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica in a pilot scaled CW treating municipal wastewater. In the mesocosms, average CH4 emissions were significantly higher in SFCW (436 +/- 32 and 518 +/- 46 mg m(-2) d(-1)). than SSFCW (319 +/- 65 and 210 +/- 74 mg m(-2) d(-1)), and plant density did not affect such emissions. SSFCW showed higher ammonia and nitrate removal efficiencies than SFCW and also showed higher N2O emissions (17 +/- 3 and 23 +/- 5 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Phosphate removal efficiencies were significantly higher in SFCW than SSFCW. In the pilot scale CW, no nitrous oxide emissions were observed and average CH4 emission (11,000 +/- 930 mg m(-2) d(-2)) was higher in the zones near the outflow planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica than in the zones near the inflow planted with Typha sp (4500 +/- 800 mg m(-2) d(-2)) and Cyperus papyrus (5500 +/- 600 mg m(-2) d(-2)), although TOC was higher in the zones near the inflow. We concluded that substrate and water flow are important factors controlling greenhouse gas emissions in CW and the amount of Zantedeschia aethiopica plants did not influence the emissions. Differences in methane emissions in the zones planted with native wetland plants in comparison with zones planted with Zantedeschia aethiopica might indicate that methane production and consumption in CW is influenced differently by the ornamental plants than by native wetland plants.

Resilience of carbon and nitrogen removal due to aeration interruption in aerated treatment wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Aeration; Constructed wetland; Domestic wastewater; Aeration stop; System dynamics	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; INTERMITTENT AERATION; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; ORGANICS; SYSTEMS; DISTURBANCES; PERFORMANCE; BACTERIA	Treatment wetlands have long been used for domestic and industrial wastewater treatment. In recent decades, treatment wetland technology has evolved and now includes intensified designs such as aerated treatment wetlands. Aerated treatment wetlands are particularly dependent on aeration, which requires reliable air pumps and, in most cases, electricity. Whether aerated treatment wetlands are resilient to disturbances such as an aeration interruption is currently not well known. In order to investigate this knowledge gap, we carried out a pilot-scale experiment on one aerated horizontal flow wetland and one aerated vertical flow wetland under warm (T-water > 17 degrees C) and cold (T-water < 10 degrees C) weather conditions. Both wetlands were monitored before, during and after an aeration interruption of 6 d by taking grab samples of the influent and effluent, as well as pore water. The resilience of organic carbon and nitrogen removal processes in the aerated treatment wetlands depended on system design (horizontal or vertical flow) and water temperature. Organic carbon and nitrogen removal for both systems severely deteriorated after 4-5 d of aeration interruption, resulting in effluent water quality similar to that expected from a conventional horizontal sub-surface flow treatment wetland. Both experimental aerated treatment wetlands recovered their initial treatment performance within 3-4 d at T-water < 17 degrees C (warm weather) and witin 6-8 d (horizontal flow system) and 4-5 d (vertical flow system) at T-water < 10 degrees C (cold weather). In the vertical flow system, DOC, DN and NH4-N removal were less affected by low water temperatures, however, the decrease of DN removal in the vertical flow aerated wetland at T-water > 17 degrees C was twice as high as in the horizontal flow aerated wetland. The quick recovery of treatment performance highlights the benefits of aerated treatment wetlands as resilient wastewater treatment technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An alternative operation strategy, i.e., the first stage anaerobic up-flow and the remaining stage tidal flow with effluent recirculation, was investigated to achieve the goal with good treatment performance of 82% COD, 91% BOD5, 92% SS, 94% NH4-N, and 82% TN removal. Two kinetic models, i.e., first-order model and Monod plus continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) flow model, were employed for predicting the removal dynamics. The results showed that the tidal flow strategy enhances oxygen transport and diffusion, thus improving reduction of organics and NH4-N. Effluent recirculation could further increase elimination of organics by extending the interaction time and also benefit the denitrification process. In addition, denitrification could be further enhanced by anaerobic up-flow in the first stage.

The artificial aerobic respiration and nitrification took place in the upper aerobic section (AES), while grass powders and sawdust were mixed in the bottom anaerobic section (ANS) to supply organic carbon source for denitrification bacteria, and the reduction was increased by iron addition in the ANS. Measured resident concentrations from the bottom of each ANS column were assumed to represent mean values averaged over the column cross-sectional area. The TMSIS with hydraulic loading rates (HLR) of 0.32, 0.24, and 0.16 m(3) m(-2) day(-1) and with wetting-drying ratio (R-WD) of 1.0 showed remarkable removal efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N, and TP, respectively. The hydraulic loading rate of 0.32 m(3) m(-2) day(-1) was selected as the optimal HLR due to the high contaminated runoff treatment efficiency. When R-WD was 1.0, 0.5, or 0.2 with hydraulic loading rate of 0.32 m(3) m(-2) day(-1), the TMSIS could treat synthetic urban runoff contaminants very well. The corresponding effluent water met the China's national quality standard for class V surface water. The wetting-drying ratio of 0.5 with hydraulic loading of 0.32 m(3) m(-2) day(-1) was selected as the optimal operation conditions for the TMSIS. Aerobic respiration and nitrification mainly took place in the upper AES, in which most of the COD and the NH4+-N were removed. Mixed sawdust and grass powders used as a carbon source and heterotrophic denitrification were put at the bottom of the ANS. The developed TMSIS has the potential to be applied for urban non-point pollution removal.

However, the effects of CW design, plant presence, and different plant species on the microbial community in CWs have not been fully explored. This study aims to investigate the microbial community metabolic function of different types of CWs used to treat ibuprofen via community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis. We studied the interactions between three CW designs (unsaturated, saturated and aerated) and six types of mesocosms (one unplanted and five planted, with Juncus, Typha, Berula, Phragmites and Iris) treating synthetic wastewater. Results show that the microbial activity and metabolic richness found in the interstitial water and biofilm of the unsaturated designs were lower than those of the saturated and aerated designs. Compared to other CW designs, the aerated mesocosms had the highest microbial activity and metabolic richness in the interstitial water, but similar levels of biofilm microbial activity and metabolic richness to the saturated mesocosms. In all three designs, biofilm microbial metabolic richness was significantly higher (p < .05) than that of interstitial water. Both the interstitial water and biofilm microbial community metabolic function were influenced by CW design, plant presence and species, but design had a greater influence than plants. Moreover, canonical correlation analysis indicated that biofilm microbial communities in the three designs played a key role in ibuprofen degradation. The important factors identified as influencing ibuprofen removal were microbial AWCD (average well color development), microbial metabolic richness, and the utilization of amino acids and amine/amides. The enzymes associated with co-metabolism of L-arginine, L-phenyl-oalanine and putrescine may be linked to ibuprofen transformations. These results provide useful information for optimizing the operational parameters of CWs to improve ibuprofen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A better understanding of the CWtw functioning is required to evaluate their real performance. To achieve this, in situ continuous monitoring of nitrate and ammonium concentrations with ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) can provide valuable information. However, this measurement needs precautions to be taken to produce good data quality, especially in areas with high effluent quality requirements. In order to study the functioning of a CWtw instrumented with six ISE probes, we have developed an appropriate methodology for probe management and data processing. It is based on an evaluation of performance in the laboratory and an adapted field protocol for calibration, data treatment and validation. The result is an operating protocol concerning an acceptable cleaning frequency of 2 weeks, a complementary calibration using CWtw water, a drift evaluation and the determination of limits of quantification (1 mgN/L for ammonium and 0.5 mgN/L for nitrate). An example of a 9-month validated dataset confirms that it is fundamental to include the technical limitations of the measuring equipment and set appropriate maintenance and calibration methodologies in order to ensure an accurate interpretation of data.

Coli; Dairy livestock wastewater	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE-FLOW; FURNACE STEEL SLAG; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; COLD CLIMATE; DAIRY; EFFLUENT; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHATE; SYSTEMS	Pollutant removal was compared among subsurface flow constructed wetland (CW) mesocosms used for dairy farm wastewater treatment. Supplemental aeration, flow direction, and the use of phosphorus-reducing filters (PRFs) were varied among the CWs. The following were compared: (1) vertical flow CWs with and without supplemental aeration, (2) aerated CWs with horizontal and vertical flow directions, (3) single-cell and two-cell treatment systems, and (4) wetland-wetland systems (two CWs in series) and wetland-PRF systems (a CW followed by a PRF). The results from this investigation showed that, first, nearly all treatment strategies, either singly or in pairs, substantially reduced almost all the contaminants we tested. Second, supplemental aeration resulted in higher ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) removal efficiencies in aerated vertical flow CWs, compared to unaerated CWs. However, it caused no further improvement in dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total suspended solids (TSS), E. coli, or BOD5 removal. Third, there was no difference between aerated horizontal and aerated vertical flow CWs in removal of any of the tested contaminants. Fourth, adding a second stage of treatment significantly improved DRP, TSS, E. coli, and NH4-N removal, but not BOD5. Finally, treatment systems with PRFs showed superior performance in DRP and E. coli removal.

The study compared the performance of the three pilot HSSFCWs, two planted with Vetiveria zizanioide and Phragmite karka, and one without plants, and all containing aeration facilities in treating municipal wastewater. HSSFCWs were loaded at a hydraulic loading rate of 0.025 m/d and a maximum organic loading rate of 6.16 g BOD/m(2)d with a hydraulic retention time of 6 days. Results show that V. zizanioide had better removal efficiencies (TSS: 92.3%; BOD5: 92.0%; PO43-: 86.7%) than P. karka (TSS: 91.3%; BOD5: 90.5%; PO43-: 85.6%), whereas P. karka showed better removal efficiency of NH4+ (86%), NO3- (81.8%) and SO42- (91.7%) than V. zizanioide (NH4+: 83.4%; NO3-: 81.3%; SO42-: 90.5%). Removal rates in unplanted CWs were lower for all parameters: TSS (78%), BOD5 (73%), NH4+ (61.0%), NO3- (55.5%), PO43(67.6%), SO42- (78.1%). Higher removals of total coliform (3 log units) and Escherichia coli (2.4 log units) were obtained in the HSSFCW with plants compared to unplanted units (total coliform: 1.9 log units; Escherichia coli: 1.2 log units). Based on these findings, the treated water can be directly disposed into surface water bodies or used for irrigation as the concentrations of the pollutants are below the standard permissible limits of effluent discharge set by EEPA and WHO. Therefore, both V. zizanioide and P. karka are good candidates for remediation of wastewater by a constructed wetland system.

Three devices of blank control (CK), microbial fuel cell (MFC) and MFC-CW were investigated. The inherent relationship between substrate degradation and electricity generation were evaluated by the electronic characteristics. The maximum voltage of MFC-CW was obtained at the electrode spacing of 13 cm. The maximum power density of MFC and MFC-CW were 0.59 and 1.53 mW/m(2) respectively. The maximum nitrobenzene removal rate of 92.89% was attained in the MFC-CW when the concentration ratio of nitrobenzene to chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 1:16 with hydraulic retention time at 24 h. The COD removal rate was between 67.92% and 78.30%, and the MFC-CW was efficient for COD degradation.

Six elements including treatment performance, land use, capital investment, operation and maintenance, cost of treatment, and electricity consumption are discussed in this study. The technologies assessed are extended aeration (EA), moving bed bioreactor (MBBR), sequential bioreactor (SBR), rotating biological contactor (RBC), on-site package (aerobic and/or anaerobic), and membrane bioreactor (MBR). The results indicate that the treatment efficiencies of all cluster-type WWTPs differed significantly from on-site anaerobic package (AnP) types. On the other hand, the treatment efficiencies of on-site aerobic package (AP) systems were reasonably comparable to those of cluster-type plants. The land use for on-site package treatment systems was estimated between 0.125 and 0.8m(2) per population equivalent (pe) and higher than for cluster-type WWTPs, which require between 0.039 and 0.159m(2)/pe. The data collected from this study show that package plant treatment costs are high compared with those of cluster types, ranging from US$0.0676 to 0.1045 (+/- 10%) and from US$0.0353 to 0.1891/m3 (+/- 15-20%), respectively. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was undertaken for all the WWTPs and among the considered environmental benefits nitrogen removal contributed to the most. Moreover, the operation of WWTPs was found to be economically viable even without the sale of treated water, except for one AnP plant. For all plants evaluated, specific power consumption (SPC) was found to vary between 0 and 1kW/m(3). (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In this study, two types of vertical flow (VF) CWs equipped with intermittent aeration-non biochar and intermittent aeration-biochar were introduced to comparatively evaluate the nitrogen removal performances and transmission under different influent strengths of low C/N wastewaters. The results showed that biochar-aerated VFCWs achieved higher removal efficiencies for organic matter (95-97%), NH4+-N (63-98%) and TN (63-82%) under various influent strengths when comparing with non-biochar-aerated VFCWs. Simultaneously, lower N2O emissions (271-884 mu gm(-2) h(-1)) were also obtained in biochar-aerated VFCWs. However, nitrogen removal decreased with the increasing influent strength in both types of VFCWs, which suggested that weak denitrification would restrict nitrogen removal under low influent strengths, while high influent strengths resulted in low nitrification in VFCWs. The results demonstrated that the combination of biochar and aeration in VFCWs could be an alternative strategy for prompting nitrogen removal and reducing N2O emissions, especially for treating low C/N wastewaters with low and middle strengths.

Compared with un-aerated SFCW, the introduction of exhaust gas into SFCW significantly improved NH4+-N, TN and COD removal efficiencies by 68.30 +/- 2.06%, 24.92 +/- 1.13% and 73.92 +/- 2.36%, respectively. The pollutants removal mechanism was related to the microbial abundance and the highest microbial abundance was observed in the SFCW with exhaust gas because of the introduction of exhaust gas from sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and thereby optimizing nitrogen transformation processes. Moreover, SFCW would significantly mitigate the risk of exhaust gas pollution. SFCW removed 20.00 +/- 1.23%, 34.78 +/- 1.39%, and 59.50 +/- 2.33% of H2S, NH3 and N2O in the exhaust gas, respectively.

CW clogging deposits and withered Pontederia cordata L. were collected into a complex fermentation broth to serve as the carbon source and its effects on the denitrification capacity and microbial composition of the CW were examined. Addition of the complex fermentation broth into the CW influent (1.8% salinity) led to high removal efficiencies of NH4+-N > 99.82 +/- 0.00% and TN > 90.39 +/- 0.05%. Heterotrophic nitrifiers and aerobic denitrifiers were entirely dominant in the middle and upper layers of the CW, where obligate halophilic, aerobic denitrifiers Zobellella occurred. The CW successfully cultivated and enriched heterotrophic nitrifying-aerobic denitrifying bacteria, overcoming the effects of salinity and insufficient organic carbon sources on the denitrification capacity of CW. This type of complex carbon sources can also facilitate the utilization of waste resources, such as CW clogging deposits and withered wetland plants.

Results showed that low N2O emission rate (1.43 mg/m(2).h) and conversion rate (0.1% accounting for influent TN) were obtained when CNR increased up to as high as 10. The highest N2O emission (3.14 mg/m(2).h) was observed at CNR of 6. Instead, independent of CNR variations, 0-75 cm was the main contributor for N2O emission. The results indicated that layered sampling method is necessary in revealing N2O spatial distribution in soil layers. Carbon source availability and nitrogen load and their ratio (i.e. CNR) determined N2O emission rate. CNR of medium level leads to an increase in N2O emission rate.

J	Ilyas, H; Masih, I				Ilyas, Huma; Masih, Ilyas			The effects of different aeration strategies on the performance of constructed wetlands for phosphorus removal	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Review						Constructed wetlands; Dissolved oxygen; Orthophosphate; Oxidation-reduction potential; Total phosphorus; Wastewater	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; REED BED SYSTEM; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; PILOT-SCALE; EFFLUENT RECIRCULATION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; SEWAGE-TREATMENT; ORGANIC-MATTER; RIVER WATER	The effects of different aeration methods such as tidal flow (TF), effluent recirculation (ER), and artificial aeration (AA) on the performance of vertical-flow constructed wetland (VFCW), horizontal-flow constructed wetland (HFCW), and hybrid constructed wetland (HCW) are extensively and critically evaluated in this review paper. Aerated constructed wetlands (CWs) demonstrate superior performance compared with non-aerated systems. The removal of total phosphorus (TP) showed substantial variation among different types of CWs and aeration strategies, with mean and standard deviation of 68 +/- 20% estimated from all reviewed studies on aerated systems. The TF-VFCW designated the highest removal efficiency and removal rate of 88 +/- 6% and 2.6 +/- 2.5 g m(-2) day(-1), respectively, followed by the ER-HCW with values of 79 +/- 18% and 1.3 +/- 0.7 g m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The superior performance of TF-VFCW could be attributed to a positive effect of TF in rejuvenating the wetland with fresh air, thus enhancing dissolved oxygen (DO) in the system, and augmenting phosphorus precipitation and adsorption to the substrate. A positive correlation of TP and orthophosphate (PO4 (3-)-P) with DO indicates that the improvement in DO levels due to redox manipulation with aeration strategies facilitates the phosphorous removal processes (e.g., through precipitation and adsorption to the substrate). The conflicting results on the impact of AA and ER reported by many studies need the cautious interpretation of their impact and require further studies. Only few studies have examined the impact of oxidation-reduction potential on phosphorous removal, which requires more attention in future research, as it appears as an important factor in enhancing the phosphorus removal.

Constructed wetlands have been recognized as providing many benefits for wastewater treatment including water supply and control by recycling water. This research aims to find the best condition to significantly remove nitrogen using constructed wetland for recycling water of Bojongsoang Waste Water Treatment Plan (WWTP) effluent. Using media of soil, sand, gravel, and vegetation (Typha latifolia and Scirpus grossus) with an aeration system, BOD and COD parameters have been remarkably reduced. On the contrary, the removal efficiency for nitrogen is only between 50-60%. Modifications were then conducted by three step of treatment, i.e., Step I is to remove BOD/COD using Typha latifolia with an aeration system, Step II is todecrease nitrogen using Scirpus grossus with/without aeration, and Step III isto complete the nitrogen removal with denitrification process by Glycine max without aeration. Results of the research show that the nitrogen removal has been successfully increased to a high efficiency between 80-99%. The combination of aeration system and vegetation greatly affects the nitrogen removal. The vegetation acts as the organic nitrogen consumer (plant uptake) for amino acids, nitrate, and ammonium as nutrition, as well as theoxygen supplier to the roots so that aerobic microsites are formed for ammonification microorganisms.

Two lab-scale VSSFs were operated: a) one was planted with A. africanus (vertical flow planted, VFP), and b) the other was unplanted (vertical flow control, VFC). The operation strategy was divided into three phases and consisted of increasing the ammoniacal nitrogen loading rate (ALR) (Phase I: 1.4; Phase II: 2.4; Phase III: 4.4g NH4+-N center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)). Nitrification was evaluated in the system at two different depths in the VSSFs (30.5cm and 60.3cm, from the top of the system). The removal efficiencies of COD, BOD5, TP, and PO4-3-P were above 40% in the VFP and VFC during all operation. The mean removal efficiencies of NH4+-N were above 70%. Nitrification was the principal NH4+-N removal mechanism in both systems and transformed more than 50% of the NH4+-N to NO3--N. In terms of the effect of A. africanus on NH4+-N removal during the three operational phases, nonsignificant differences between the two VSSFs were noted (p > 0.05). Thus, A. africanus did not influence nitrification. Finally, the analysis at different depths showed that nitrification occurred in the upper 30.5cm.

The membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR) is a promising alternative compared to conventional technologies. In this work, a pilot-scale MABR system was employed to treat polluted surface water in continuous-flow mode. The nitrogen removal performances with the variations of the aeration parameters, hydraulic loading and C/N ratio were explored. The results showed that intra-membrane pressure plays a dominant role in improving the denitrification rate. The nitrification dynamics of the MABR system were favoured in conditions of low influent C/N ratios and hydraulic loading, but limit the denitrification process due to insufficient carbon source. A counter optimal hydraulic loading of 0.016 m(3)/(m(2) day) (hydraulic retention time of 36h), and a corresponding increase in the influent C/N ratio was beneficial for nitrogen removal. When the influent C/N ratio was raised to a factor of 8, the total organic carbon (TOC), ammonium and total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency could reach 80.0%, 92.2% and 60.3%, respectively. This indicated that the MABR has a potential to remove TN by simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) in polluted surface water treatment.

The AP was employed to provide oxygen supply to the CW at alternating 3 h on and off. Batch test and prototype lab-scale test experiments were conducted in the laboratory to determine oxygen transfer coefficient (K(L)a) and oxygen consumption rate (q(O2)C(X)) values using samples from the AP. Field test monitoring was also performed to determine the water quality changes in the AP. Based on the field test monitoring, the effluent DO from the AP was increased by almost 20% due to the aeration. The K(L)a((20 degrees C)) and q(O2)C(X) values obtained from the field tests were relatively higher in comparison with the values reported from other wastewater treatment technologies signified an increase in oxygen transfer in the AP. Findings showed that the AP is operating with high K(L)a and low qO(2)C(X) which resulted to high cost in aeration system operation. Consequently, it is suggested that non-aeration time could be increased more than the aeration operation time of 3 h.

For the aforementioned purpose, an artificial wetland system (AWS) was constructed and filled with water hyacinth collected from the Valsequillo Reservoir, Puebla, Mexico. Potassium hydrogen phthalate and sodium tartrate were measured in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). The present study indicated that the water hyacinths absorbed nearly 1.8-16.6 g of COD kg(-1) dm (dry mass of water hyacinth), while the absorbance efficiency of BOD was observed to be 45.8%. The results also indicated that the maximum absorbance efficiency of malathion, 2,4-D, and piroxicam was observed to be 67.6%, 58.3%, and 99.1%, respectively. The kinetics of organic compounds fitted different orders as malathion followed a zeroth-order reaction, while 2,4-D and piroxicam followed the first-order reactions. Preliminary assessment of absorption of heavy metals by the water hyacinth in the AWS was observed to be (all values in mg g(-1)) 7 (Ni), 13.4 (Cd), 16.3 (Pb), and 17.5 (Zn) of dry biomass, thus proving its feasibility to depurate wastewater.

Results of the 12 months study revealed that the optimal iron-toactive carbon mass ratio (Fe/C), initial pH value and iron with active carbon-to-water volume ratio (Fe-C/water) of ICME were 1: 1, 4.0 and 1: 4 respectively. Meanwhile, the BOD5-to-COD concentration ratio (B/C) of FHTWW was increased from an average value of 0.16-0.39, which indicated the effluent of ICME not only met the national standard for subsequent HFCWs, but also was appropriate to further biological treatment. Generally, the COD removal efficiency of the hybrid system could increase by more than 30% compared with HFCWs only. Although the concentration of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) in raw FHTWW varied greatly between seasons, their average removal rate reached 96.8 +/- 1.2% and 95.9 +/- 1.4% respectively depending on appropriate COD-to-TN ratio (C/N) of 3.08-6.19 and limited dissolved oxygen (DO) of 0.5-0.7 mg/L. The hybrid system has withstood the unusually rainy season in July 2016. Results showed that the average COD, BOD5 and NH4+-N concentration in the final effluent were 28.3 mg/L, 5.8 mg/L and 1.3 mg/L respectively, which satisfied the environmental quality standards for surface water in China (COD <= 30 mg/L, BOD5 <= 6 mg/L, NH4+-N <= 1.5 mg/L).

The results showed that a superior NO3-N removal rate was observed in W1 with a C/N ratio of 6.5, and a high NH4+-N removal rate was obtained when the W2 was operated with 6-h duration of idle. In the long-term operation for 45 days, the two-stage DSCW pilot system achieved high and stable removal of TN, NH4+-N and NO3-N, which were 92.9%, 83.7% and 95.6% in average, respectively. The microbial communities between W1 and W2 were significant different. Rich diversity of the microbial community and the high proportion of denitrifying bacteria in the W1 were essential for nitrogen removal in this treatment system. AOB in the W2 played a major role in NH4+-N removal in W2. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The performances of nitrogen removal, microbial abundance and microbial community structure in the biofilm attached on PHBV/PLA were investigated. Higher ammonia removal efficiency (91.00%) and total nitrogen removal efficiency (97.03%) than non-aerated constructed wetland (System NA) were achieved in constructed wetland with limited aeration (System A). The limited aeration decreased the average concentrations of COD in effluent. And, System A had higher microbial abundance than System NA. Pyrosequencing analysis showed that denitrifying bacteria Brevinema (41.85%) and Thiothrix (12.33%) were the predominant genus in the biofilm attached on the carbon source in System NA and System A, respectively.

Over the last decades, CWs have gained increased popularity for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater. This review highlights the practice, application, and research on wetland technology, placing them in the overall context of the need for reliable and sustainable solutions to managing agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater. A critical assessment of the performance and effectiveness of wetland systems for removing various contaminants of importance to agriculture is presented. The design parameters and operational conditions affecting the efficiency of contaminant removal in CWs receiving agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater are also discussed. The role of proper pretreatment, artificial aeration, effluent recirculation, in-series design, and microbial dynamics on the enhancement of treatment is provided. Challenges and perspectives for future research on agricultural treatment wetlands are also addressed.

Planted systems had higher ibuprofen removal rates (29%-99%) than in the unplanted ones (15%-85%) in all designs. The use of forced aeration improved ibuprofen removal only in the unplanted mesocosms. In general, ibuprofen removal followed an area-based first-order removal kinetics model with removal rate coefficients (k(A)) varying between 3 and 35 cm/d. The ibuprofen removal was mainly attributed to microbial degradation by the fixed bed biofilm, but plant uptake and degradation within plant tissues also occurred. The ibuprofen removal was positively correlated with the oxygen concentration in the water and the removal of nutrients, indicating that degradation may be due to co-metabolisation processes.

Therefore, low concentration wastewater has restricted effects on nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The purpose of this study is to treat dormitory sewage with a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) ranging from 50 to 150 mg/L using dewatered alum sludge-based sequencing batch constructed wetland system. Vegetation in the wetland system was chosen to be Phragmites australis. Three parallel cases were carried out to assess impacts due to different hydraulic retention time (HRT) and artificial aeration. The results showed that this system is effective in removing total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) under different HRT. However, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission poses to be the greatest challenge in the high HRT cases. Artificial aeration could reduce N2O emission but is associated with high operational cost. Results indicate that dewatered alum sludge-based sequencing batch constructed wetland system is a promising bio-measure in the treatment of low concentration wastewater.

Removal of selected emerging PPCP compounds using greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Greater duckweed; PPCPs; Constructed wetland; Stabilization tank; Treatment; Orthogonal design	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; MUNICIPAL WASTE-WATER; TREATMENT PLANTS; URBAN WASTEWATERS; PHARMACEUTICALS; SYSTEM; CONTAMINANTS; DEGRADATION; PERFORMANCE; TRICLOSAN	Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results showed that the glucose systems generated higher N2O emissions than those of the sodium acetate systems. The higher amount of N2O-releasing fluxes in the CWs than in the YWs was consistent with the higher NO2--N accumulation in the former than in the latter. Moreover, electron competition was tighter in the CWs and contributed to the incomplete denitrification with poor N2O production performance. Illumina MiSeq sequencing demonstrated that some denitrifying bacteria, such as Denitratisoma, Bacillus, and Zoogloea, were higher in the YWs than in the CWs. This result indicated that the carbon source is important in controlling N2O emissions in microbial communities.

Hydraulic and biotic impacts on neutralisation of high-pH waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Alkaline drainage; Biofilm; Mesocosm; Neutralisation; Passive treatment	BAUXITE-RESIDUE LEACHATE; IN-VITRO EXPERIMENTS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS; PRECIPITATION KINETICS; CALCITE PRECIPITATION; RESIDENCE TIME; ALKALINE; TRAVERTINE; SYSTEM	The management of alkaline (pH 11-12.5) leachate is an important issue associated with the conditioning, afteruse or disposal of steel slags. Passive in-gassing of atmospheric CO2 is a low cost option for reducing Ca(OH)(2) alkalinity, as Ca(OH)(2) is neutralised by carbonic acid to produce CaCO3. The relative effectiveness of such treatment can be affected by both the system geometry (i.e. stepped cascades versus settlement ponds) and biological colonization. Sterilized mesocosm experiments run over periods of 20 days showed that, due to more water mixing and enhanced CO2 dissolution at the weirs, the cascade systems (pH 11.2 -> 9.6) aremore effective than settlement ponds (pH 11.2 -> 11.0) for lowering leachate alkalinity in all the tested conditions. The presence of an active microbial biofilm resulted in significantly more pH reduction in ponds (pH 11.2 -> 9.5), but had a small impact on the cascade systems (pH 11.2 -> 9.4). The pH variation in biofilm colonized systems shows a diurnal cycle of 1 to 1.5 pH units due to CO2 uptake and release associated with respiration and photosynthesis. The results demonstrate that, where gradient permits, aeration via stepped cascades are the best option for neutralisation of steel slag leachates, and where feasible, the development of biofilm communities can also help reduce alkalinity.

This study investigated the occurrence of PFASs in the leachate of a capped landfill site in Singapore and the efficacy of PFASs removal during flow through a constructed wetland (CW) treatment system. The CW treatment system consists of equalization tank, aeration lagoons, sedimentation tank, reed beds and polishing ponds. Target compounds included 11 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) (7 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 4 perfluoroalkane sulfonates (PFSAs)) and 7 PFAA precursors. Although total PFASs concentrations in the leachate varied widely (1269 to 7661 ng/L) over the one-year sampling period, the PFASs composition remained relatively stable with PFCAs consistently being predominant (64.0 +/- 3.8%). Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) concentrations were highly correlated with total PFASs concentrations and could be an indicator for the release of PFASs from this landfill. The release of short-chain PFAAs strongly depended on precipitation whereas concentrations of the other PFASs appeared to be controlled by partitioning. Overall, the CW treatment system removed 61% of total PFASs and 50-96% of individual PFASs. PFAAs were removed most efficiently in the reed bed (42-49%), likely due to the combination of sorption to soils and sediments and plant uptake, whereas most of the PFAA precursors (i.e. 5:3 fluorotelomer carboxylate (5:3 acid), N-substituted perfluorooctane sulfonamides (N-MeFOSAA and N-EtFOSAA)) were removed in the aeration lagoon (>55%) by biodegradation. The sedimentation tank and polishing ponds were relatively inefficient, with only 7% PFASs removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The wetland technologies investigated included conventional horizontal flow, unsaturated vertical flow (single and two-stage), horizontal flow with aeration, vertical flow with aeration, and reciprocating. Treatment efficiency for classical wastewater parameters and EOCs generally increased with increasing design complexity and dissolved oxygen concentrations. The two aerated wetlands and the two-stage vertical flow system showed the highest EOC removal, and the best performance in warm season and most robust performance in the cold season. These three systems performed better than the adjacent conventional WWTP with respect to EOC removal. Acesulfame was observed to be removed (>90%) by intensified wetland systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter during the warm season. Elevated temperature and high oxygen content (aerobic conditions) proved beneficial for EOC removal. For EOCs of moderate to low biodegradability, the co-occurrence of aerobic conditions and low content of readily available carbon appears essential for efficient removal. Such conditions occurred in the aerated systems and with use of a tertiary treatment sand filter. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aeration successfully created aerobic condition at 50 cm depth and did not change anoxic or anaerobic condition at 80 and 110 cm depths under OLR of 5.3, 10.9 and 16.5 g BOD/(m(2) d). Meanwhile, aeration enhanced COD, NH4+-N, TN removal and the enrichment of nitrogen removal functional genes (amoA, nxrA, napA, narG, nirS, nirK, qnorB and nosZ) compared to NA SWIS. High COD removal rate of 91.6%, TN removal rate of 85.9% and low N2O emission rate of 32.4 mg/(m(2) d) were obtained in IA SWIS under OLR of 16.5 g BOD/(m2 d). Intermittent aeration is a sensible strategy to achieve high OLR, low N2O emission, satisfactory organic matter and nitrogen removal performance for SWISs.

However, studies of large-scale systems and the long-term evaluation of their treatment efficiency are scarce. This article presents the final results of a two-year study of the pollutant removal performance of a CFW in a stormwater pond capturing runoff from a low-residential catchment in South-East Queensland (Australia) under subtropical conditions. Although the CFW treatment area to catchment ratio was only 0.14%, the results demonstrated a significant removal of both Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Phosphorus (TP) from the stormwater inflows by the CFW. The efficiency ratios for TSS and TP were 81% and 52%, respectively. While the removal rate for total nitrogen was not significant for the CFW evaluated in this study, the ER was still 17%. However, the ERs for nitrate and nitrogen oxide were both 47%. The study results suggest that it may be possible to increase the pollution removal performance of the CFW by upsizing the system and including intermittent re-aeration zones in the surrounding stormwater pond. The results of this research study clearly demonstrate that CFW can be an effective treatment solution for the removal of pollution from urban stormwater runoff.

The effects of intermittent aeration and different construction waste substrates (gravel, red brick, fly-ash brick) on P processing using six batch-operated vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) were studied for decentralized domestic wastewater treatment. Average removal of total phosphorus (TP) in three aerated CWs was markedly higher (21.06, 24.83, and 27.02 mg m(-2) day(-1), respectively) than non-aerated CWs (10.64, 18.16, and 25.09 mg m(-2) day(-1), respectively). Fly-ash brick offered superior TP removal efficiency in both aerated and non-aerated batch-operated VFCWs, suggesting its promising application for P removal in CWs. Aeration greatly promoted plant growth and thusly increased plant uptake of P by 0.57-1.45 times. Substance storage was still the main P sink accounting for 23.92-59.47% of TP removal. Other process including microbial uptake was revealed to be a very important P removal pathway (accounting for 14.86-34.84%). The contribution of microbial uptake was also indicated by microbial analysis. Long-term results suggested that the contribution of microbial P uptake could be always ignored and underestimated in most CWs. A combination of intermittent aeration and suitable substrates is effective to intensify P transformation in CWs.

However, the low denitrification effect in VFCWs was a problem for treating low carbon source wastewater. In this study, intermittent aeration and biochar, produced by biomass pyrolysis, was used to promote the nitrogen removal in VFCWs for low C/N domestic wastewater. Four systems, including non-aerated with non-biochar VFCW, non-aerated with biochar VFCW, aerated with non-biochar VFCW and aerated with biochar VFCW, were conducted for comparing their treatment performances. The results showed that much higher removal of COD (94.9%), NH4+-N (99.1%), TN (52.7%) and lower N2O emission (60.54 mu g.m(-2).h(-1)) was obtained in aerated VFCW with biochar addition. The results suggested that adding biochar to intermittent aerated VFCWs could be an effective and appropriate strategy for low C/N wastewater treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Aeration created aerobic condition in 50 cm depth and did not change anoxic or anaerobic condition in 80 and 110 cm depths, which enhanced NH4+-N and TN removal and the enrichment of nitrogen removal functional genes (amoA, nxrA, narG, napA, nirK, nirS, qnorB and nosZ) compared to NA SWIS, especially under high influent C/N ratio. High TN removal rate (89.6%) was obtained in IA SWIS under the influent C/N ratio of 12, which was higher than that in CA SWIS (87.1%).

And aeration plays an important role in its sustainable operation, as well as economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, two patterns to reduce aeration intensity, i.e., semi aeration (SA) and intermittent aeration (IA) were used to improve the economic and environmental benefits of media-based aquaponics. Results showed that SA aquaponics, in which the energy efficiencies on culturing fish and crop were improved respectively by 78.20% and 77.61% compared with Control, had the potential to obtain higher economic benefits. Although both SA and IA could save half of the aeration cost by reducing aeration flux and time respectively, the product yields in SA weren't impaired seriously while in IA aquaponics they were. And the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of SA aquaponics was 113% higher than that of IA aquaponics, mainly attributed to the more stable dissolved oxygen concentration in SA. Better water quality was obtained in IA aquaponics, however, it was achieved at the cost of higher N loss (mainly in the form of N-2), which subsequently reduced the potential for further improvement of NUE. Both SA and IA could considerably reduce GHG emissions from aquaponics, due to lower energy requirement. IA aquaponics showed the lowest N2O emission, but the primary source (over 97%) of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from aquaponics was off-site indirect CO2 emission. Taking productivity and environmental impact into consideration, semi-aeration was believed to be a better choice when reducing aeration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study provides the first information on the occurrence of selected ECs and ARGs in raw leachate from 16-year old closed landfill site in Singapore. Among the investigated ECs, acetaminophen (ACT), bisphenol A (BPA), clofibric acid (CA), caffeine (CF), crotamiton (CTMT), diclofenac (DCF), N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), gemfibrozil (GFZ), lincomycin (LIN), salicylic acid (SA), and sulfamethazine (SMZ) were the most frequently detected compounds in raw landfill leachate. The concentrations of detected ECs in raw landfill leachate varied significantly, from below quantification limit to 473,977 ng/L, depending on the compound. In this study, Class I integron (intl1) gene and ten ARGs were detected in raw landfill leachate. Sulfonamide resistance (sul1, sul2, and dfrA), aminoglycoside resistance (aac6), tetracycline resistance (tetO), quinolone resistance (qnrA), and intl1 were ubiquitously present in raw landfill leachate. Other resistance genes, such as beta-lactam resistance (blaNMD1, blaKPC, and blaCTX) and macrolide-lincosamide resistance (ermB) were also detected, detection frequency of <50%. The removal of target ECs and ARGs by a full-scale hybrid constructed wetland (CW) was also evaluated. The vast majority of ECs exhibited excellent removal efficiencies (>90%) in the investigated hybrid CW system. This hybrid CW systemwas also found to be effective in the reduction of several ARGs (intl1, sul1, sul2, and qnrA). Aeration lagoons and reed beds appeared to be the most important treatment units of the hybrid CW for removing the majority of ECs from the leachate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effluent pollutant (chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+-N, total phosphorus (TP)) concentrations during the experiment were determined to reveal pollutant removal mechanisms and efficiencies at different stages. In the stable stage, a VFCW using clay ceramisite substrate under aeration attained higher COD (95.1%), and NH4+-N (95.1%) removal efficiencies than a VFCW using corncob charcoal substrate (91.5% COD, 91.3% NH4+-N) under aeration, but lower TP removal efficiency (clay ceramisite 32.0% and corncob charcoal 40.0%). The VFCW with raw corncob substrate showed stronger COD emissions (maximum concentration 3,108 mg/L) than the corncob charcoal substrate (COD was lower than influent). The VFCW using corncob charcoal substrate performed much better than the VFCW using clay ceramisite substrate under aeration when the C/N ratio was low (C/N = 1.5, TN removal efficiency 36.89%, 4.1% respectively). These results suggest that corncob charcoal is a potential substrate in VFCWs under aeration with a unique self-supplying carbon source property in the denitrification process.

Laboratory- and full-scale studies on the removal of pharmaceuticals in an aerated constructed wetland: effects of aeration and hydraulic retention time on the removal efficiency and assessment of the aquatic risk	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						forced bed aeration; hazard quotient; hybrid; light expanded clay aggregate (LECA); sub-surface flow	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ACTIVE COMPOUNDS; CLOFIBRIC ACID; POLLUTANTS; CARBAMAZEPINE; CONTAMINANTS; ECOTOXICITY; SYSTEM; IMPACT; SPAIN	Pharmaceutical residues in wastewater pose a challenge to wastewater treatment technologies. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are common wastewater treatment systems in rural areas and they discharge often in small water courses in which the ecology can be adversely affected by the discharged pharmaceuticals. Hence, there is a need for studies aiming to improve the removal of pharmaceuticals in CWs. In this study, the performance of a full-scale aerated sub-surface flow hybrid CW treating wastewater from a healthcare facility was studied in terms of common water parameters and pharmaceutical removal. In addition, a preliminary aquatic risk assessment based on hazard quotients was performed to estimate the likelihood of adverse effects on aquatic organisms in the forest creek where this CW discharges. The (combined) effect of aeration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) was evaluated in a laboratory-scale batch experiment. Excellent removal of the targeted pharmaceuticals was obtained in the full-scale CW (>90%) and, as a result, the aquatic risk was estimated low. The removal efficiency of only a few of the targeted pharmaceuticals was found to be dependent on the applied aeration (namely gabapentin, metformin and sotalol). Longer and the HRT increased the removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac and tramadol.	[Auvinen, Hannele; Rousseau, Diederik P.

J	Liu, GQ; Wang, JM				Liu, Guoqiang; Wang, Jianmin			Achieving advanced nitrogen removal for small flow wastewater using a baffled bioreactor (BBR) with intermittent aeration	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Small-flow wastewater treatment; Nitrogen removal; Baffled bioreactor; Intermittent aeration	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; STABILIZATION PONDS; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; SEPTIC SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; PHOSPHORUS	Nitrogen discharge from decentralized and onsite wastewater treatment systems, such as recirculating sand filters, stabilization ponds, and septic tanks, is an important source of groundwater and surface water contamination. This study demonstrated a simple baffled bioreactor (BBR) technology, operated with an intermittent aeration mode, that effectively removed nearly all nitrogen for small flow wastewater treatment. The BBR is characterized by an aeration zone, followed by an integrated internal settler, which automatically retains a high biomass concentration of approximately 6 g/L without using a separate sludge return device. Long-term testing results indicated that this process had reduced the chemical oxygen demand and total nitrogen concentration to approximately 20 mg/L and less than 3 mg-N/L, respectively, under an operational temperature of 7.1 degrees C to 24.7 degrees C. The average effluent ammonia and nitrate concentrations were 0.75 and 0.61 mg-N/L, respectively, indicating that both nitrification and denitrification had been completed. In addition to nitrogen removal, this BBR had removed approximately 65% of the total phosphorus. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The plant species could significantly affect the CH4 emission in integrated vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands (IVSSF CWs). This study evaluated the removal efficiency of water pollutants and determined the influence of plant species on CH4 fluxes in IVSSF CWs planted with Cyperus alternifolius, Canna indica, Acorus calamus, and Scirpus tabernaemontani. Result indicated that the pollutant removal efficiency in IVSSF CWs planted with C. alternifolius was apparently higher than that in the wetlands planted with the three other plants. The mean removal efficiencies in CWs planted with C. alternifolius were 84.46% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 85.80% for NH4-N, 82.94% for total nitrogen, and 94.87% for total phosphorous. The average CH4 fluxes were 5.45 mg m(-2) h(-1) (A. calamus), 2.49 mg m(-2) h(-1) (S. tabernaemontani), 9.26 mg m(-2) h(-1) (C. indica), and 3.25 mg m(-2) h(-1) (C. alternifolius). The CH4 fluxes in IVSSF CWs planted with C. alternifolius, C. indica, and S. tabernaemontani were significantly correlated with temperature (P < 0.05). Moreover, the CH4 fluxes in IVSSF CWs planted with C. indica and A. calamus significantly differed between up-flow and down-flow chambers (P < 0.05). The relationship between CH4 flux and removal loading of COD was also analyzed. S. tabernaemontani and A. calamus were found to be the optimal plants for COD removal in IVSSF CWs in summer and winter, respectively. The results can be helpful for plants optimization in CWs and provide the data support for the control of GHG emission.

Aerobic conditions were effectively developed in 50 cm depth of the matrix and anoxic or anaerobic conditions were not changed in 80 and 110 cm depth by intermittent aeration, which encouraged nitrification. Increased influent COD/N ratio led to lower COD and nitrogen removal in conventional SWISs. Sufficient carbon source in high COD/N ratio influent promoted denitrification with intermittent aeration. High removal rates of COD (95.68 +/- 0.21%), TP (92.02 +/- 0.28%), NH4+-N (99.33 +/- 0.05%), and ( 89.65 +/- 0.6%) were obtained with influent COD/N ratio of 12 in aerated SWISs. Under the COD/N ratio of 12 and 18, intermittent aeration boosted the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria. Meanwhile, nitrate and nitrite reductase activities with intermittent aeration were higher than that without aeration in 80 and 110 cm depths.

The removal efficiencies of nine types of intensified constructed wetlands (CWs) were examined in detail and their mean and standard deviation were estimated at 89 +/- 11%, 84 +/- 12%, 81 +/- 17% and 63 +/- 20% for total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN), respectively. From the studied CWs, ER-HCW, TF-HCW, AA-VFCW and ER-VFCW emerged as the four best performing systems. The overall removal efficiency of TSS, COD, NH4+-N and TN by ER-HCW was 98 +/- 2%, 85 +/- 11%, 83 +/- 15% and 73 +/- 11%, respectively. Specifically, the ER enhances the interactions between pollutants and micro-organisms, consequently, the efficient removal of NH4+-N and TN has been achieved in ER-HCW. The TF has a positive effect in refreshing the wetland with fresh air to enhance the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the system. In case of AA, intermittent aeration is more effective than continuous aeration, as it facilitates the establishment of aerobic and anaerobic conditions suitable for nitrification and denitrification. Statistical analysis shows that DO, organic loading rate and specific surface area requirement are the most significant factors that influence the performance of intensified CWs.

An air contact oxidation bed (ACOB) and embedded trickling filter (TF) with filled volcano rock, was designed to increase dissolved oxygen (DO) in cathodic EMBR to save aeration cost. Membrane fouling in EMBR was successful inhibited/reduced by the generated bioelectricity of the system. The combined system demonstrated superior effluent quality in removing chemical oxygen demand (>97%) and ammonia nitrogen (>93%) during the stable operation, and the phosphorus removal was about 50%. Dominant bacteria (Nitrosomonas sp.; Comamonas sp.; Candidatus Kuenenia) played important roles in the removal of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen.

We aim to study plant species-specific effects of iron toxicity when grown in the iron-rich sediments of lake Markermeer (the Netherlands). Using three sediment sources that varied in total Fe and Fe-P concentrations, we performed a greenhouse experiment to study the development of three wetland species that differ in their tolerance to iron and utilization capacity of Fe-P: Rumex maritimus, Phragmites australis and Eupatorium cannabinum. Phragmites australis was the only species that developed an epidermis-damaging iron plaque on its roots. Plaque formation mainly depended on the Fe(III) and Fe-P concentration of the sediment, which led to different nutrient imbalances in leaves. All three species showed reduced growth compared to the control substrate, which could not be linked to indirect Fe toxicity. In contrast, direct Fe toxicity following the uptake of Fe could not be excluded as a mechanism potentially explaining our results, and this result warrants further examination in longer-term experiments. Our results highlight the importance of considering the Fe and Fe-P availability in sediments, as these properties may constrain plant performance and delay the development of pioneer ecosystems in wetland construction sites.

J	Wang, M; Zhang, DQ; Dong, JW; Tan, SK				Wang, Mo; Zhang, Dong Qing; Dong, Jian Wen; Tan, Soon Keat			Constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment in cold climate - A review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Review						Constructed wetlands; Wastewater treatment; Nutrient; Cold climate	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE-FLOW; NITROGEN REMOVAL; PILOT-SCALE; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; SURFACE-FLOW; EFFLUENT RECIRCULATION; TREATMENT PERFORMANCE; SEWAGE-TREATMENT; DOMESTIC SEWAGE; RIVER WATER	Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been successfully used for treating various wastewaters for decades and have been identified as a sustainable wastewater management option worldwide. However, the application of CW for wastewater treatment in frigid climate presents special challenges. Wetland treatment of wastewater relies largely on biological processes, and reliable treatment is often a function of climate conditions. To date, the rate of adoption of wetland technology for wastewater treatment in cold regions has been slow and there are relatively few published reports on CW applications in cold climate. This paper therefore highlights the practice and applications of treatment wetlands in cold climate. A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of contaminant removal in different wetland systems including: (1) free water surface (FWS) CWs; (2) subsurface flow (SSF) CWs; and (3) hybrid wetland systems, is presented. The emphasis of this review is also placed on the influence of cold weather conditions on the removal efficacies of different contaminants. The strategies of wetland design and operation for performance intensification, such as the presence of plant, operational mode, effluent recirculation, artificial aeration and in-series design, which are crucial to achieve the sustainable treatment performance in cold climate, are also discussed. This study is conducive to further research for the understanding of CW design and treatment performance in cold climate.

Aeration not only successfully created aerobic conditions at 50 cm depth, but also did not change anoxic or anaerobic conditions at 80 and 110 cm depths. Meanwhile, aeration significantly enhanced chemical oxygen demand, NH4+ -N, and total nitrogen (TN) removal and the enrichment of nitrogen removal functional genes (amoA, nxrA, napA, narG, nirK and qnorB) compared to the non-aerated SWIS, especially for high HLRs. IA SWIS (79.7%-85.8%) had a better performance on TN removal compared with CA SWIS (73.8%-82.2%) when the HLRs ranged from 0.06 to 0.3 m(3)/(m(2) d). Intermittent aeration is a sensible strategy to achieve high HLR, good nitrogen removal performance and comparatively low operation cost for SWISs.

The performance of a multistage sub-surface flow wetland treating municipal landfill leachate was assessed during three years of operation. During the study three research periods with different operation conditions were established. The hydraulic loads, operation mode of vertical flow beds and type of treated wastewater ( raw leachate -leachate mixed with municipal wastewater) were changed. Removal of organic matter and nitrogen species was evaluated in each period. The average COD removal efficiency varied from 47.8% to 86.6%. The average total nitrogen removal efficiencies were 98.5%, 68.9% and 79.6% in subsequent research periods. The main problem was too high concentration of recalcitrant organic matter. The labile organic matter was completely removed however the effluent COD remained on relatively high level. Depletion of labile organic matter also limited denitrification resulting in incomplete total nitrogen removal. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, JH; Lu, XW				Li, Juanhong; Lu, Xiwu			Performance and Microbial Diversity in a Low-Energy ANF-WDSRBC System for the Post-Treatment of Decentralized Domestic Wastewater	WATER			English	Article						decentralized domestic wastewater; ANF-WDSRBC; nitrification; denitrification; high-throughput MiSeq sequencing	ROTATING BIOLOGICAL CONTACTOR; NITROGEN REMOVAL; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; PILOT-SCALE; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; BACTERIAL COMMUNITY; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; REACTOR; BIOFILM; RBC	Recently, more decentralized wastewater treatments are of great interest for rural regions. In this work, a novel ANF-WDSRBC system combined with an anoxic filter (ANF) and a four-stage water-dropping-self-rotating biological contactor (WDSRBC) was designed as a post-treatment option. With a total hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 8.8 h and reflux ratio of 1:1, the ANF-WDSRBC system was operated 160 days. The results showed the ANF-WDSRBC system had better performance without mechanical aeration devices, the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) were 61.4% +/- 4.3%, 86.1% +/- 3.7%, and 54.5% +/- 3.9%, respectively. By means of high-throughput MiSeq sequencing, the results suggested that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi were the predominant phyla in the system. In the WDSRBC units, Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Bacillus, and Nitrospira were the main genera to take part in nitrification. Longilinea, Bellilinea, Thiobacillus, and Thauera in the ANF unit were the main genera to participate in denitrification and organic matters degradation. The novel ANF-WDSRBC system had great potential in the post-treatment of decentralized domestic wastewater.

This review paper provides insights on different strategies applied for the reduction of land area including stack design and intensification of CWs with different aeration methods. The impacts of different aeration methods on the performance and land area reduction were extensively and critically evaluated for nine wetland systems under three aeration strategies such as tidal flow (TF), effluent recirculation (ER), and artificial aeration (AA) applied on three types of CWs including vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW), horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFCW), and hybrid constructed wetland (HCW). The area reduction and pollutant removal efficiency showed substantial variation among different types of CWs and aeration strategies. The ER-VFCW designated the smallest footprint of 1.1 +/- 0.5 m(2) PE-1 (population equivalent) followed by TF-VFCW with the footprint of 2.1 +/- 1.8 m(2) PE-1, and the large footprint was of AA-HFCW (7.8 +/- 4.7 m(2) PE-1). When footprint and removal efficiency both are the major indicators for the selection of wetland type, the best options for practical application could be TF-VFCW, ER-HCW, and AA-HCW. The data and results outlined in this review could be instructive for futures studies and practical applications of CWs for wastewater treatment, especially in land-limited regions.

NASH; PHYTOREMEDIATION; REMOVAL; BIODEGRADATION; PEROXIDASE	This research evaluated the feasibility of using vetiver plantlets (Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash) on a floating platform with aeration to degrade phenol (500 mg/L) in illegally dumped industrial wastewater (IDIWW). The IDIWW sample was from the most infamous illegal dumping site at Nong Nae subdistrict, Phanom Sarakham district, Chachoengsao province, Thailand. Laboratory results suggested that phenol degradation by vetiver involves two phases: Phase I, phytopolymerization and phyto-oxidation assisted by root-produced peroxide (H2O2) and peroxidase (POD), followed by phase II, a combination of phase I with enhanced rhizomicrobial degradation. The first 360-400 h of phenol degradation were dominated by phytopolymerization and phyto-oxidation yielding particulate polyphenols (PPP) or particulate organic matter (POM) as by-products, while phenol decreased to around 145 mg/L. In Phase II, synergistically, rhizomicrobial growth was similar to 100-folds greater on the roots of the vetiver plantlets than in the IDIWWand participated in the microbial degradation of phenol at this lower phenol concentration, increasing the phenol degradation rate by more than three folds. This combination of phytochemical and rhizomicrobiological processes eliminated phenol in IDIWW in less than 766 h (32 days), while without the vetiver plantlets, phenol degradation by aerated microbial degradation alone may require 235 days. To our knowledge, this is the first that systematically reveals the complete phenol degradation mechanism by vetiver plantlets in real aerated wastewater.

It was demonstrated that nitrite pathway was successfully and stably achieved in CWs by using modified intermittent aeration control with aeration 20 min/non-aeration 100 min and reducing DO concentration during aeration, nitrite in the effluent could accumulate to over 70% of the total oxidized nitrogen. Q-PCR analysis showed that nitrifying microbial communities were optimized under the alternating anoxic and aerobic conditions, ammonia oxidizing bacteria increased from 7.15 x 10(6) to 8.99 x 10(6) copies/g, while nitrite oxidizing bacteria decreased approximately threefold after 234 days operation. Most importantly, high nitrogen removal efficiency with ammonium removal efficiency of 94.6%, and total nitrogen removal efficiency of 82.6% could be achieved via nitrite pathway even under carbon limiting conditions. In comparison to the nitrate pathway, the nitrite pathway could improve the TN removal by about 55%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This integrated novel system owns the striking features of adding carriers of wetland substrate (i.e. the dewatered alum sludge in this case) in CAS for robust phosphorus adsorption and enriching the biomass. Meanwhile, the "green" feature of this GBR imparted aesthetic value of CW to the CAS system. The preliminary 3-month trial of GBR based on a sequencing batch reactor (GB-SBR) with diluted piggery wastewater demonstrated an average removal of 96%, 99% and 90% for BOD, TP and TN, respectively. The comparison with moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) reflected the advantages of GBR over purification performance, aesthetic value and potential carbon sink. Moreover, the carriers used in the GBR are dewatered alum sludge which is in line with the policy of "recycle, reuse and reduce". Overall, this GBR undoubtedly offered a more sustainable and economical solution for retrofitting the aging CAS. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and ranged from 13.2 ng/L to 51.8 mu g/L. Activated sludge was characterized in the terms of phylogenetic and catabolic diversity of microbial community, as well as its morphology. Proteobacteria (24.0%) represented the most abundant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes (19.8%) and Firmicutes (13.2%). Bioaugmentation of wastewater with activated sludge stimulated the biodegradation process for 14 compounds. The concentration of carbamazepine in non-amended and bioaugmented WW decreased during the first 17 h up to 30% and 70%, respectively. Diclofenac and ibuprofen demonstrated comparatively slow removal. The stimulating effect of the added nutrients was observed for the degradation of almost all pharmaceuticals detected in WW The most pronounced effect of nutrients was found for erythromycin. The results were compared with those obtained for the full-scale WW treatment process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Shunt ratio significantly affected nitrogen removal during operation of the TFCW with adoption of a modified step feeding mode. When the shunt ratio was 1:2, TFCW had the best pollutant removal performance and was particularly effective for total nitrogen (TN). The abundance of nitrogen transformation microorganisms was also affected by the shunt ratio of the system. Molecular biological analyses demonstrated that both denitrification and anammox were enhanced when the shunt ratio was greater than 0:1, resulting in the development of multiple and complete nitrogen removal pathways in the TFCW. These results show that the optimal shunt ratio of the modified single-stage TFCW for effective nitrogen removal was 1:2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two monitoring campaigns were carried out at 17 (I) and 29 (II) months of operation, at surface loading rates of 2.5 and 4.7 g BOD5 m(-2) d(-1) respectively. Significant differences between units for TS density and most characteristics of accumulated solids were not found. On the contrary, significant differences existed between near inlet and outlet zones as well as between campaigns I and II. In aerobic conditions, approximately 35% of accumulated solids COD was biodegradable at maximum rates of 4.4 -12.0 g COD m(-2) d(-1). In anaerobic conditions only 4% of accumulated solids COD was biodegradable at maximum rates of 0.2-0.8 g COD m(-2) d(-1). Thus, promoting aerobic conditions prevents clogging. HC was approximately 16% lower in planted units than in the unplanted unit while a similar drainable porosity drop (13-18%) was registered. The results showed that the presence/absence of vegetation and plant species did not significantly affect clogging in HSSF CWs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Constructed wetlands (CWs) are likely to receive wastewater containing nanoparticles leaching from products during usage. Therefore, we investigate the retention of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) in microcosms simulating CWs treating domestic wastewater. The effects of aeration and organic matter content on the Ag-NP removal efficiencies are studied in particular. CWs remove most of the Ag (80-90%) and the largest fraction of Ag is found in/on the biofilm. Detailed electron microscopy analyses suggest that Ag-NPs are transformed into Ag2S in all microcosm experiments. The good correlation between total suspended solids (TSS) and the Ag concentration measured in the effluent indicates that Ag-NPs are bound to the solids in the effluent. Aeration of the microcosms does not affect the release of Ag-NPs from the systems but increasing organic matter leads to increased amounts of Ag passing the CWs, correlating with the increased release of TSS from the CWs. These results suggest that Ag-NPs are retained with the (suspended) solids in CWs and that the removal efficiency of TSS is an important factor determining the discharge of Ag-NPs from CWs.

The wetland system planted with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reeds) was operated between June 2011 and October 2015, while the pond system was only operated between July 2015 and October 2015. Three different types of ponds were compared: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration. Findings regarding the performances of mature wetlands showed that the wetland systems improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), where the treatment performance reduced slightly over time. In general, the aerated pond systems showed better treatment performances in terms of ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) and PO4-P. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. The highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH4-N and PO4-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Removal of pharmaceuticals by a pilot aerated sub-surface flow constructed wetland treating municipal and hospital wastewater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Pilot-scale; Pharmaceutical; Intensified wetland; Aeration	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; EMERGING ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS; HYDRAULIC LOADING RATES; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; TREATMENT PLANTS; ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS; ADVANCED OXIDATION; SEWAGE-TREATMENT	Constructed wetlands are often used as decentralized wastewater treatment and as treatment systems for small communities. The effluent is usually discharged in small water courses in which the aquatic ecosystem can be put at risk by pharmaceutical residues present in the effluent. This study describes the performance of a pilot-scale aerated subsurface-flow constructed wetland treating municipal and hospital wastewater. Especially the effect of active aeration on the removal of selected pharmaceuticals is assessed. The removal of metformin and valsartan is significantly increased when continuous aeration is applied (99 +/- 1% vs. 68 +/- 32% for metformin and 99 +/- 1% vs. 17 +/- 19% for valsartan), although the micro-organisms can adapt to degrading metformin also in anoxic conditions. At the hospital site high concentrations of pharmaceuticals are measured in the influent. Atenolol and bisopfolol are efficiently removed (> 75% and > 50%, respectively), although the effluent concentrations of these compounds remain high (up to 0.5 mu g/L). Only limited removal of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gabapentin and sulfamethoxazole is achieved. Intermittent aeration (50%) provides equally efficient removal of the selected pharmaceuticals as continuous aeration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The pilot-scale PTS design compared two treatment series, both consisting of an unplanted, gravel cell, followed by a cell planted with one of two different species of emergent macrophyte (Carex) taken from the Kumtor site. Regardless of the hydraulic retention time tested (HRT; 3-18 h), on average approximately 19% of the ammonia was removed by the systems. However, 3-5 times more ammonia load was removed at faster flow rates (HRT between 3.0 and 4.5 h). Within each PTS system, the unplanted, gravel cell removed a greater percentage of the total ammonia treated than the (B) cells with either vegetation type. This was likely due to depletion of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the (A) cells proportional to ammonia oxidation at these HRT, thus limiting DO available in (B) cells for further treatment. Microbial community profiling of the pilot-scale systems revealed a greater proportion of known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria Nitrosomonas in (A) cells compared to (B) cells. Pilot-scale testing suggested that depleted DO is responsible for the finite extent of removal, and aeration methods to increase the dissolved oxygen content may further improve treatment. Ultimately the data from this study demonstrates that HRT affects the treatment kinetics of ammonia treatment, while extent of treatment is limited by availability of dissolved oxygen. The results of the pilot-scale testing suggest that passive treatment of ammonia is possible for discharge waters of the effluent treatment plant at the Kumtor Mine, and can be used to inform the design and size requirements of a full-scale system.

The results indicated that intermittent aeration in vertical upflow CWs significantly enhanced organic matter (>69%, 214-401 g/m(2) d) and ammonium (>92%, 62-138 g/m(2) d) removal, regardless of aeration position. However, the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) was limited to 24%-40%. Effluent recirculation was examined to enhance TN removal up to 69% in the central aerated CW, as compared to 44% observed in the bottom aerated CW. Accordingly, significantly higher abundances of denitrifiers (nirK and nirS) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria (anammox) were found in the bottom layer of the central aerated CW. In addition, the central aerated CW coupled with effluent recirculation generated significantly higher electricity (maximum power density of 112 mW/m(2)) than traditional bottom aerated CWs when integrated with a microbial fuel cell (MFC). Results confirmed the application potential of this new configuration of upflow CW integrated with central aeration and effluent recirculation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluating the Life Cycle Environmental Benefits and Trade-Offs of Water Reuse Systems for Net-Zero Buildings	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TREATING WASTE-WATER; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; NITROUS-OXIDE; ENERGY USE; TREATMENT PLANTS; SUPPLY-SYSTEMS; UNITED-STATES; EMISSIONS; SCALE; SUSTAINABILITY	Aging water infrastructure and increased water scarcity have resulted in higher interest in water reuse and decentralization. Rating systems for high-performance buildings implicitly promote the use of building-scale, decentralized water supply and treatment technologies. It is important to recognize the potential benefits and trade-offs of decentralized and centralized water systems in the context of high-performance buildings. For this reason and to fill a gap in the current literature, we completed a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the decentralized water system of a highperformance, net-zero energy, net-zero water building (NZB) that received multiple green building certifications and compared the results with two modeled buildings (conventional and water efficient) using centralized water systems. We investigated the NZB's impacts over varying lifetimes, conducted a break-even analysis, and included Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. The results show that, although the NZB performs better in most categories than the conventional building, the water efficient building generally outperforms the NZB. The lifetime of the NZB, septic tank aeration, and use of solar energy have been found to be important factors in the NZB's impacts. While these findings are specific to the case study building, location, and treatment technologies, the framework for comparison of water and wastewater impacts of various buildings can be applied during building design to aid decision making. As we design and operate high-performance buildings, the potential trade-offs of advanced decentralized water treatment systems should be considered.

Results showed that endocrine disruption chemicals (EDCs) were better removed by membrane bioreactor (MBR), activated sludge and aeration processes among different biological processes. Surfactants, EDCs and personal care products (PCPs) can be well removed by activated sludge process. Pesticides and pharmaceuticals showed good removal efficiencies by biological activated carbon. Microalgae treatment processes can remove almost all types of ECs to some extent. Other biological processes were found less effective in ECs removal from wastewater. Chemical oxidation processes such as ozonation/H2O2, UV photolysis/H2O2 and photo Fenton processes can successfully remove up to 100% of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals, while EDCs can be better removed by ozonation and UV photocatalysis. Fenton process was found less effective in the removal of any types of ECs. A hybrid system based on ozonation followed by biological activated carbon was found highly efficient in the removal of pesticides, beta blockers and pharmaceuticals. A hybrid ozonation-ultrasound system can remove up to 100% of many pharmaceuticals. Future research directions to enhance the removal of ECs have been elaborated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of the different designs and the operational (planted and aeration or not) variables on the long-term treatment. The four devices used in the experiment, including aerated and planted CW (APCW), planted CW (PCW), aerated CW (ACW) and unaerated and unplanted CW(UCW), had the identical dimensions of 3 m in length, 0.7 m in width and 1 m in depth. Removal efficiencies of BOD and TN in APCW reached up to 94.4% and 86.0%. Also, BOD and TN removal of APCW varied little with the seasonal change, while that of PCW, ACW, and UCW had considerable fluctuation. Aeration had a significant influence on phosphorus removal in the long term, and plants could disrupt the structure of substrate to extend the time of absorption saturation. Correlation analysis showed that aeration and plants could accelerate CW to obtain a steady state either for BOD or TN removal. In the long run, we also found that removal rates of TN, TP, and organic matter were increased, decreased and almost constant, respectively.

J	Wang, L; Li, T				Wang, Ling; Li, Tian			Seasonal effects of pre-aeration on microbial processes for nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Pre-aeration; Anammox; Denitrification; Partial nitrification; Constructed wetland; Wastewater treatment	ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION; RICH WASTE-WATER; ANAMMOX; NITRITE; TEMPERATURE; BACTERIA; NITRIFICATION; ENRICHMENT; REACTOR	Seasonal effects of pre-aeration on microbial nitrogen performance in constructed wetlands (CWs) involved with anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process were investigated in this study. Slow natural re-acration rate was the inhibiting factor for total nitrogen removal in CW without pre-aeration, and partial nitrification was the main way for nitrite generation. Besides partial nitrification, prcacration provided nitrite generation inCWs with an alternative way: nitrate reduction. Advantage of pre-aeration of influent was much different under various temperature ranges. Mean temperature of 15 degrees C seemed to be the turning point. With a mean temperature of or higher than 15 degrees C, nitrate in the influent effectively improved nitrogen removal in CWs. With a mean temperature lower than 15 degrees C, the nitrate reduction process in CWs was greatly inhibited. The benefit of pre-aeration was weak under this temperature range. Seasonal aeration pattern for the pre-treatment of HSSF CWs might be a more energy-saving alternative in in-suit domestic sewage treatment.

Results indicated that gravel-slag-wood chips extended aerobic/anaerobic alternating environment to gravel and slag zones and maintained anaerobic condition in the subsequent wood chip section. The order of gravel-slag-wood chip was more beneficial to pollutant removal. Sufficient carbon source supply resulted from wood-chip-framework substrate simultaneously obtained high removals of COD (97%), NH4+-N (95%), and TN (94%) in BSFCWs at 2 h aeration per day. The results suggest that intermittent aeration combined with wood chips could achieve high nitrogen removal in BSFCWs.

Alternative treatment configurations were evaluated with different waste collection practices as well as various schemes for nitrogen and phosphorus removal. All treatment systems fulfilled the required quality of the treated effluent in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations. However, only the configurations performing the short-cut nitrification/denitrification with biological phosphorus removal met the specifications for water reuse. The environmental assessment included the analysis of impacts on climate change (CC), freshwater eutrophication (FE) and marine eutrophication (ME). A functional unit (FU) of 2000 people receiving treatment services was considered. The most relevant sources of environmental impacts were associated to the concentration of dissolved methane in the UASB effluent that is emitted to the atmosphere in the SBR process (accounting for 41% of impacts in CC), electricity consumption, mainly for aeration in the SBR (representing 14% of the impacts produced in CC), and the discharge of the treated effluent in receiving waters (contributing 98% and 57% of impacts in FE and ME, respectively). The scheme of separate waste collection together with biological nitrogen removal and phosphorus uptake via nitrite was identified as the best configuration, with good treated effluent quality and environmental impacts lower than those of the other examined configurations.

Performance of ornamental plants in mesocosm subsurface constructed wetlands under different organic sewage loading	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constructed wetland; Organic loading rate; Ornamental plant; Sewage treatment; Tulbaghia violacea	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIME; REMOVAL; SYSTEM; AERATION; EFFLUENT; NITROGEN; ZEOLITE; DESIGN	The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of ornamental plant species in mesocosm subsurface constructed wetlands (CWs) to treat sewage under different organic loading rates (OLRs). The effect of ornamental plant species was evaluated in four mesocosm CWs with: (a) Iris pseudacorus (MCW-Ip), (b) Eichornia crassipes (MCW-Ec), (c) Tulbaghia violacea (MCW-Tv), and (d) Cyperus papyrus (MCW-Cp). The OLRs were evaluated as follows: (a) 0.47 gCOD/(m(2)d) (Phase I), (b) 0.84 gCOD/(m(2)d) (Phase II), and (c) 1.94 gCOD/(m(2)d) (Phase III). Inside the four mesocosm CWs during the three phases showed oxidation-reduction potential and dissolved oxygen below 50 mV and 0.7 mg/L, respectively, which are characteristic values of anoxic-anaerobic environments. The 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiencies were above 50% for the four mesocosm CWs in the three phases. In the cases of NH4+-N and PO4-3-P, removal efficiency was above 70% only for MCW-Cp during the three phases. When the OLR increased, BOD5, COD, TSS, NH4+-N, PO4-3-P and fecal coliform (FC) effluent concentrations from the four mesocosm CWs were affected in a significant way (alpha < 0.05) (except PO4-3-P in MCW-Cp). The species of ornamental plant showed nonsignificant (alpha > 0.05) effect on COD and BOD5 effluent concentrations for Phase I, II and III. Conversely, Tulbaghia violacea and Cyperus papyrus had a significant influence (alpha < 0.05) in the NH4+-N, PO4-3-P and FC, effluent concentrations during Phase II and III. Therefore, these two species of ornamental plants have greater potential to treat sewage under different OLRs, even though Tulbaghia violacea is a plant that has not been used previously in CWs.

In raw wastewater, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) is the main nitrogen form, accounting for 70%-82% of the TN concentration. Organic nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) are present as well. For years, due to the lack of regulatory limits on nitrogen concentration in surface waters, nitrogen from secondary effluent has posed a significant threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems. Researchers have made substantial efforts to reduce the nitrogen concentration in secondary effluent. As a kind of advanced wastewater treatment technology, the subsurface infiltration (SI) system has been widely used, owing to its advantages, which include low operation cost, easy maintenance, and low energy consumption. This review discusses the fate of various forms of nitrogen in SI treatment, including organic nitrogen, NH4+-N, NO2--N, and NO3--N. Major biological processes involved in nitrogen removal and the main factors influencing its transformation are suggested. Finally, it is shown that ammonification followed by nitrification-denitrification plays a major role in nitrogen removal. Further research needs to focus on the emission characteristics of gaseous nitrogen (generated from the nitrification, denitrification, and completely autotrophic nitrogen-removal over nitrite (CANON) processes) with respect to their greenhouse effects.

In industries, this will also lead to overall plant operational cost reduction. In this study, a pilot-scale surface-flow constructed wetland system filled with water hyacinth was used to treat effluent from existing sewage treatment plant at Batamindo Industrial Park. The sewage treatment plant effluent with quality fulfilling the regulation of Indonesian Ministry of Environment No.5/2014/XLVII-Group I was treated further to meet the raw water quality standard of Class I defined by Indonesian Government Regulation No.82/2001 as potable water resource. The system was able to maintain high chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of around 80% from initial value of 100 mg/L in sewage treatment plant effluent despite the change of flow rate from 10 to 40 m(3)/day (corresponding to hydraulic retention time of 2 to 0.5 days in constructed wetland respectively). The constructed wetland could successfully increase dissolved oxygen concentration, remove coliform bacteria and improve clarity (reduce turbidity) of water while maintaining neutral pH and low TSS values. Some additional post-treatments such as simple aeration and ultraviolet irradiation may improve the water quality further to meet the Class I Standard of potable water resource.

A pilot wetland facility, in conjunction with a biofilm aeration facility, was constructed at Lake Maryout by Alexandria coast, where primary treated wastewater of 50,000 m(3)/day is being handled. The satisfactory results of water quality parameters of the pilot wetland effluent were compared with the performance of the wastewater-natural treatment facility located at Arcata Bay, CA. The results provide motivations for further large scale wetland applications in the available land of Maryout Valley where fresh water supplies are low. Highlights are presented on use of safe wastewater sludge and bio-solids for restoration of constructed and natural wetlands, which serve for coastal defense; e.g. at the Nile Rosetta headland, San Francisco Bay, and the Central Wetlands in Louisiana, USA.

Twelve mesocosm-scale CWs with four substrates and three hydraulic loading rates were set up in the outdoor. The result showed the CWs with zeolite as substrate and HLR of 20cm/d were selected as the best choice for the TN and NH3-N removal. It was found that the single-stage mesocosm-scale CWs were incapable to achieve high removals of TN and NH3-N due to inefficient nitrification process in the systems. This was demonstrated by the lower abundance of the nitrification genes (AOA and AOB) than the denitrification genes (nirK and nirS), and the less diverse nitrification microorganisms than the denitrification microorganisms in the CWs. The results also show that microorganism community structure including nitrogen-cycle microorganisms in the constructed wetland systems was affected by the design parameters especially the substrate type. These findings show that nitrification is a limiting factor for the nitrogen removal by CWs.

In this paper, a novel reoxygenation corridor was set up in vertical flow subsurface constructed wetlands (VFCWs) to improve the subsurface oxygen transfer and pollutants removal. The experiment results indicated that the existence of corridor can improve the internal oxygen environment of VFCWs and the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N). The feeding rate experiment results showed that the best removal of COD, NH 4 +-N and total nitrogen (TN) were 89.6%, 71.0% and 57.4%, respectively. Moreover, in feeding frequency experiments, the best removal efficiency of COD, NH4+-N and TN were 86.9%, and 77.8% and 58.4%, respectively. Finally, the 180 L/h feeding rate and 12 times/d feeding frequency were selected as optimal operation conditions. These findings can give useful guidance for the design and operation of VFCWs with a reoxygenation corridor.

The ABCW reactor was planted with common reed (Phragmite australis) where the hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 1 day and was fed with synthetic wastewater with the addition of Amaranth dye. Supplementary aeration was supplied in designated compartments of the ABCW reactor to control the aerobic and anaerobic zones. After Amaranth dye addition the COD reduction efficiency dropped from 98 to 91% while the color removal efficiency was 100%. Degradation of azo bond in Amaranth dye is shown by the UV-Vis spectrum analysis which demonstrates partial degradation of Amaranth dye metabolites. The performance of the baffled unit is due to the longer pathway as there is the up-flow and down-flow condition sequentially, thus allowing more contact of the wastewater with the rhizomes and micro-aerobic zones.

Wetland was divided into four zones along the length (zone I to IV), and influent was introduced into first and third zones by step feeding. Continuous study was carried out in four phases. In phases I to III, 30% of influent was bypassed to zone III for denitrification along with organics removal. Intermittent aeration was provided only in zone II at 2.5 L/min for 4 h/day, during phases II, III and IV. In phase I, 87% COD and 43% NH4+-N (ammonia-nitrogen) removal were obtained from influents of 331 and 30 mg/L, respectively. In phase II study, external aeration resulted in 97% COD and 71% NH4+-N removal in the wetland. In phase IV, 40% of feed was delivered to zone III. Higher supply of organic in zone III resulted in higher denitrification, and total nitrogen removal rate increased to 70% from 56%. In the final effluent, concentration of NO3--N was 9-11 mg/L in phase I to III and decreased to 4 mg/L in phase IV. Batch study showed that COD and NH4+-N removal followed first order kinetics in different zones of wetland.

Aeration rates were varied from 1900 to 0 mL/min and a control reactor was operated without supplementary aeration. 600 mL/min was the optimum aeration flow rate to achieve highest energy recovery as the oxygen was sufficient to use as terminal electron acceptor for electrical current generation. The maximum voltage output, power density, normalized energy recovery and Coulombic efficiency were 545.77 +/- 25 mV, 184.75 +/- 7.50 mW/m(3), 204.49 W/kg COD, 1.29 W/m(3) and 10.28%, respectively. The variation of aeration flow rates influenced the NO3 and NH4+ removal differently as nitrification and denitrification involved conflicting requirement. In terms of wastewater treatment performance, at 60 mL/min aeration rate, UFCW-MFC achieved 50 and 81% of NO3 and NH4+ removal, respectively. E. nuttallii enhanced nitrification by 17% and significantly contributed to bioelectricity generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The HIGHWET plant in A Coruna (NW of Spain) treating municipal wastewater consists of a HUSB and four parallel subsurface horizontal flow (HF) CWs. HF1, HF2 and HF3 units are fitted with forced aeration, while the control HF4 is not aerated. All the HF units are provided with effluent recirculation, but different heights of gravel bed (0.8 m in HF1 and HF2, and 0.5 m in HF3 and HF4) are implemented. Besides, a tobermorite-enriched material was added in the HF2 unit in order to improve phosphorus removal. The HUSB 76-89% of total suspended solids (TSS) and about 40% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD). Aerated HF units reached above 96% of TSS, COD and BOD at a surface loading rate of 29-47 g BOD5/m(2).d. An aeration regime ranging from 5 h on/3 h off to 3 h on/5 h off was found to be adequate to optimize nitrogen removal, which ranged from 53% to 81%. Average removal rates of 3.4 +/- 0.4 g total nitrogen (TN)/m(2).d and 12.8 +/- 3.7 g TN/m(3).d were found in the aerated units, being 5.5 and 4.1 times higher than those of the non-aerated system. The tobermorite-enriched HF2 unit showed a distinct higher phosphate (60-67%) and total phosphorus (54%) removal.

Intensified nitrate and phosphorus removal in an electrolysis-integrated horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Electrolysis; Nitrate removal; Horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland(HFCW); Phosphorus removal	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; BIO-CERAMSITE REACTOR; ELECTROCOAGULATION PROCESS; MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; DRINKING-WATER; SURFACE-AREA; DENITRIFICATION; SYSTEM	A novel electrolysis-integrated horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland system (E-HFCWs) was developed for intensified removal of nitrogen and phosphorus contaminated water. The dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and that of main water qualities of inflow and outflow were also evaluated. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) greatly enhanced nitrate removal when the electrolysis current intensity was stabilized at 0.07 mA/cm(2). When the HRT ranged from 2 h to 12 h, the removal rate of nitrate increased from 20% to 84%. Phosphorus (P) removal was also greatly enhanced exceeding 90% when the HRT was longer than 4 h in the electrolysis-integrated HFCWs. This improved P removal is due to the in-situ formation of ferric ions by anodizing of sacrificial iron anodes, causing chemical precipitation, physical adsorption and flocculation of phosphorus. Thus, electrolysis plays an important role in nitrate and, phosphorus removal. The diversity and communities of bacteria in the biofilm of substrate was established by the analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequiences, and the biofilm was abundant with Comamonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae bacteria in E-HFCWs. Test results illustrated that the electrolysis integrated with horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland is a feasible and effective technology for intensified nitrogen and phosphorus removal.

In this paper, two algal ponds combined with constructed wetlands were built to increase the removal performance. Different hydraulic retention time (HRT), different N/P and chemical compounds were chosen to investigate the influences of the above factors on the contaminant removal performance. The optimum phosphorus removal rate was 69.74% under the nitrogen removal of 92.85% in influent containing PO43- after 3-day HRT in algal pond combined with constructed wetlands. The investigation results indicated that these factors improved the nutrient removal efficiencies. Seasonal influence on the removal performance can be avoided by choosing the optimal HRT length of 3 days. The higher N/P at 60 can improve the phosphorus removal and the lower N/P at 15 showed the stronger synergistic effect between phosphorus and nitrogen removals. Compared with PO3- and PO43- in influent, PO43- affected phosphorus removal more significantly. The better linear fitting between organic phosphorus removal and nitrogen removal in influent contained P2O74- was found. Algae can absorb nutrients for growth, and oxygen release, microbial activity intensification and microbial carbon replenishment induced by algae will improve the performance. The study suggested that the control of HRTs, N/Ps, CCs, and algae might be an effective way to improve wastewater treatment performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It consisted of five tanks sequentially connected containing microbes, biofilm carriers and four species of floating aquatic plants. The purification performance of the system for N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) polluted river water was evaluated by operating in continuous mode. DMF was completely removed in Tanks 1 and 2 at influent DMF concentrations between 75.42 and 161.05 mg L-1. The NH4+-N concentration increased in Tank 1, followed by a gradual decrease in Tanks 2-5. Removal of NH4+-N was enhanced by aeration. The average effluent NH4+-N concentration of Tank 5 decreased to a minimum of 0.89 mgL(-1), corresponding to a decrease of 84.8% when compared with that before aeration. TN concentration did not decrease significantly as expected after inoculation with denitrifying bacteria. The average effluent TN concentration of the system was determined to be 4.58 mg L-1, still unable to satisfy the Class V standard for surface water environmental quality. The results of this study demonstrated that the Eco-tank system is an efficient process in removing DMF, TOC, and NH4+-N from DMF polluted river water. However, if possible, alternative technologies should be adopted for controlling the effluent TN concentration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Artificial aeration (AA) was applied continuously in the VBFW stage to improve the aerobic condition in the hybrid CW. Water samples were collected and analyzed twice a month between the period of August 2015 and July 2016. The results suggest that this new hybrid CW can achieve a satisfactory reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) with average removal rates of 85% +/- 10% (35% +/- 19 g/m(2) per day), 76% +/- 18% (7% +/- 2 g/m(2) per day), 65% +/- 13% (8% +/- 2 g/m(2) per day), and 65% +/- 21% (1 g/m(2) per day), respectively. AA significantly improved the aerobic condition throughout the experimental period, and the positive influence of AA on nitrogen removal was found to be higher during summer that during winter. A significant positive correlation between water temperature and nutrient removal (p < 0.01) was observed in the system. Overall, this study demonstrates the application of AA in a full-scale hybrid CW with satisfactory nutrient removal rates. The hybrid CW system with artificial aeration can serve as a reference for future applications areas where land availability is limited.	[Zhai, Jun; Xiao, Jun; Rahaman, Md.

The ABCW reactor was planted with common reed (Phragmite australis), where the hydraulic retention times was set to 1 d and was fed with synthetic wastewater. Supplementary aeration was supplied in designated compartments of the ABCW reactor to control the aerobic and anaerobic zones. The COD reduction efficiency was 98%, while the NO3--N and NH4+-N removal was 36-98%, respectively, which was due to nitrification and denitrification processes. The outstanding performance of the baffled unit was due to the longer pathway as there is the up-flow and down-flow condition sequentially, thus allowing more contact of the wastewater with the rhizomes and micro-aerobic zones.

Treatment Wetland Aeration without Electricity? Lessons Learned from the First Experiment Using a Wind-Driven Air Pump	WATER			English	Article						aerated wetland; treatment wetland; domestic wastewater; horizontal flow; energy demand	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; TREATMENT EFFICIENCY; COLD-CLIMATE; NITRIFICATION; DESIGN	Aerated treatment wetlands have become an increasingly recognized technology for treating wastewaters from domestic and various industrial origins. To date, treatment wetland aeration is provided by air pumps which require access to the energy grid. The requirement for electricity increases the ecological footprint of an aerated wetland and limits the application of this technology to areas with centralized electrical infrastructure. Wind power offers another possibility as a driver for wetland aeration, but its use for this purpose has not yet been investigated. This paper reports the first experimental trial using a simple wind-driven air pump to replace the conventional electric air blowers of an aerated horizontal subsurface flow wetland. The wind-driven air pump was connected to a two-year old horizontal flow aerated wetland which had been in continuous (24 h) aeration since startup. The wind-driven aeration system functioned, however it was not specifically adapted to wetland aeration. As a result, treatment performance decreased compared to prior continuous aeration. Inconsistent wind speed at the site may have resulted in insufficient pressure within the aeration manifold, resulting in insufficient air supply to the wetland. This paper discusses the lessons learned during the experiment.

Nitrification was the main mechanism of ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal and partial nitrification/anaerobic ammonia oxidation was a minor process. Field measurements yielded a removal rate of NH4+-N of 0.266-0.566 gN/d m(2) and a corresponding temperature dependent rate constant of 0.184 d(-1) to 0.377 d(-1) representing an improvement over nitrogen removal. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) removal was degraded to the background level of NO3--N concentration in an environment with a high concentration of dissolved oxygen. The NO3--N removal rate ranged from 0.0393 gN/d m(2) to 0.0825 gN/d m(2) and resulted from aerobic denitrification, indicating that external aeration and intermittent circulation effectively improved oxygen transportation in SSF CW. This could remove NO3--N of the effluent of SSF CW when using in-tank aeration to improve the nitrogen removal performance of SSF CW. (C) 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Intensified nitrogen removal of constructed wetland by novel integration of high rate algal pond biotechnology	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						High rate algal pond; Constructed wetland; Photosynthetic aeration; Algal carbon source; Nitrogen removal	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE-FLOW; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; INFLUENT COD/N RATIOS; CONTAMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; NUTRIENTS; DESIGN	High rate algal pond (HRAP) was combined with constructed wetland (CW) to intensify nitrogen removal through optimizing nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification and denitrification process mainly depends on the oxygen content and carbon source level in CWs. Algal biomass was enriched in HRAP, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was increased via photosynthesis. Algal debris increased COD as degradable bioresource. The results showed that HRAP-CW hybrid systems effectively promoted the nitrogen removal performance due to rich DO and COD. The extension of hydraulic retention time in HRAP significantly improved NH4-N and TN removals by 10.9% and 11.1% in hybrid systems, respectively. The highest NH4-N and TN removals in hybrid systems respectively reached 67.2% and 63.5%, which were significantly higher than those in single CW. The study suggested that the hybrid system had the application potentials in nitrogen removal from wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The intermittent aeration strategy not only significantly increased removal rates of organic pollutants and NH4+-N, but also successfully created aerobic conditions at a depth of 50 cm and did not change anoxic or anaerobic conditions at a depth of 80 and 110 cm, resulting in high TN removal. Increasing organic pollutant loading did not affect the removal of organic pollutants and nitrogen in intermittent aerated SWISs. High removal rates of COD (98.0%similar to 98.4%), NH4+-N (93.8%similar to 98.1%) and TN (84.5%similar to 94.0%) were simultaneously obtained in intermittent aerated SWISs for organic pollutant loadings ranging from 7.4 to 29.1 g COD/(m(2).d), and these removal rates were significantly higher than for non-aerated SWISs. The results suggest that intermittent aeration is a reliable option to achieve high nitrogen removal in SWISs, especially with high organic pollutant loading.

The experimental results demonstrated considerable removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in wastewater by the ecological filter, with average removal rates of 83.79%, 93.10%, 52.90%, and 79.07%, respectively. Concentration of NH4+-N after treatment met the level-A discharge standard of GB18918-2002. Compared with non-plant filter, the ecological filter improved average removal efficiency of COD, NH4+-N, TN, and TP by 13.03%, 25.30%, 14.80%, and 2.32%, respectively: thus, plants significantly contribute to the removal of organic pollutants and nitrogen. Through microporous aeration and O-2 secretion of plants, the ecological filter formed an aerobic-anaerobic-aerobic alternating environment; thus aerobic and anaerobic microbes were active and effectively removed organic pollutants. Meanwhile, nitrogen and phosphorus were directly assimilated by plants and as nutrients of microorganisms. Meanwhile, pollutants were removed through nitrification, denitrification, filtration, adsorption, and interception by the filler. High removal rates of pollutants on the ecological filter proved that it is an effective wastewater-treatment technology for decentralized wastewater of mountainous towns.

In this study, the unclogging of HSSF-CWs was evaluated, at rest, by adding a nitrogen-based nutrient solution to the influent. For this, six HSSF-CWs were used, consisting of two uncultivated (CW-C), two cultivated with Tifton 85-grass (Cynodon spp.) (CW-T) and two cultivated with alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides) (CW-A), which were fully clogged after being used for the treatment of swine wastewater. The results indicated that passage of the nutrient solution for 55 days through the bed of the HSSF-CWs resulted in reductions of 11 and 33%, respectively, in the total volatile solids (TVS) concentration of fine clogging material in the CW-T and CW-A. With regard to the TVS content of the coarse clogging material, the reduction was even greater, being 33% for CW-T and 62% for CW-A. Measurements of K-0 made along the beds (thirds 1, 2 and 3) before and after passage of the nutrient solution in the CWs indicated respective increases of 7, 13 and 0.1% in CW-C; 21, 11 and 7% in CW-T; and 52%, 6% and -6% (decrease) in CW-A. Runoff of the nutrient solution decreased gradually over time, presenting at the beginning of the experiment 26, 35 and 150 cm, and at the end (after 55 days of application) 0, 0 and 50 cm in the flow direction of the CW-C and CW-T and CW-A, respectively.

Aerobic conditions were developed in 50 cm depth and anoxic or anaerobic conditions were not changed in 80 and 110 cm depth by intermittent aeration. Under appropriate shunt ratios, shunt distributing wastewater improved denitrification and had little influence on COD, TP and NH3-N removal. Under the optimal shunt ratio of 1: 2 for SIS C, high average removal rates of COD (90.06%), TP (93.17%), NH3-N (88.20%) and TN (85.79%) were obtained, which were higher than those in SIS A (COD: 82.56%, TP: 92.76%, NH3-N: 71.08%, TN: 49.24%) and SIS B (COD: 81.12%, TP: 92.58%, NH3-N: 69.14%, TN: 58.73%) under the optimal shunt ratio of 1: 3.

Nitrifier was immobilized on a carrier pellet containing 10% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 2.0% sodium alginate (SA) and 2.0% calcium chloride (CaCl2). A batch experiment demonstrated that 73% COD and 85% ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) were degraded using the pellets with immobilized nitrifier cells. In addition, different carbon source supplement strategies were applied to remove the nitrate (NO3-N) transformed from NH4-N. An increase in COD/N ratio led to increasing reduction in NO3-N. Efficient nitrification and denitrification promoted total nitrogen (TN) removal in immobilized nitrifier biofortified constructed wetlands (INB-CWs). The results suggested that immobilized nitrifier pellets combined with high influent COD/N ratios could effectively improve the nitrogen removal performance in CWs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A phytoremediation technique (floating Vetiver system) was used to treat Palm Oil Mill Secondary Effluent (POMSE). A batch study using 40 L treatment tanks was carried out under different conditions and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the treatment process. A three factor central composite design (CCD) was used to predict the experimental variables (POMSE concentration, Vetiver plant density and time). An extraordinary decrease in organic matter as measured by BOD and COD (96% and 94% respectively) was recorded during the experimental duration of 4 weeks using a density of 30 Vetiver plants. The best and lowest final BOD of 2 mg/L was obtained when using 15 Vetiver plants after 13 days for low concentration POMSE (initial BOD = 50 mg/L). The next best result of BOD at 32 mg/L was obtained when using 30 Vetiver plants after 24 days for medium concentration POMSE (initial BOD = 175 mg/L). These results confirmed the validity of the model, and the experimental value was determined to be quite close to the predicted value, implying that the empirical model derived from RSM experimental design can be used to adequately describe the relationship between the independent variables and response. The study showed that the Vetiver system is an effective method of treating POMSE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The role of sand, marble chips and Typha latifolia in domestic wastewater treatment - a column study on constructed wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; sand; marble chips; Typha latifolia; wastewater treatment	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; NITROGEN TRANSFORMATION; REMOVAL; CONTAMINANTS; VEGETATION; AERATION; REUSE; MEDIA	The relative importance of sand, marble chips and wetland plant Typha latifolia is evaluated in constructed wetlands (CWs) for the treatment of domestic wastewater intended for reuse in agriculture. The prototype CWs for the experiments are realized in polyvinyl chloride columns, which are grouped into four treatments, viz. sand (< 2 mm) + Typha latifolia (cattail), sand, marble chips (5-20 mm) + cattail and marble chips. The removal percentage of organic and nutritional pollutants from the wastewater is measured at varying hydraulic retention time in the columns. The statistical analysis suggests that the main effects of sand and cattail are found to be significant (p<.05) for the removal of biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand from the wastewater. The presence of cattail significantly (p<.01) contributes to the conversion of total nitrogen in wastewater into NO3- by fostering the growth of favorable microbes for the nitrification. The removal of PO43- and turbidity from the wastewater is significantly (p<.01) influenced by sand than the presence of cattail. The maximum PO43- adsorption capacity of the sand is estimated to be 2.5 mg/g. Marble chips have significantly (p<.01) influenced the removal of SO42- and its maximum removal capacity is estimated to be 9.3 mg/g. The negative correlation between the filter media biofilm and column hydraulic conductivity is also reported for all the treatments. Thus, the findings of this study elucidate the role of low-cost and easily available filter media and it will guide the environmental practitioners in designing cost-effective CWs for wastewater treatment.

Performance was assessed in terms of ammonia and solids removal, hydraulic conductivity and mixing patterns. The capability of systems to produce ammonium effluent concentrations <3 mgNH(4)(+)-N/L was observed across all sites in systems receiving variable loadings between 0.1 and 13.0 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(2)/d. Potential resilience issues were observed in relation to response to spike loadings posited to be due to an insufficient nitrifying population within the beds. Hydraulic conductivity and flow mixing patterns observed suggested deterioration of the reactor effective volume over time. Overall, the study demonstrates the efficacy of the technology where ammonium removal is required on small sites receiving high and variable flow rates, with adequate removal of organics and solids, but no significant benefit to the long term hydraulics of the system.

However, the stripped effluents often still do not meet discharge standards, having high pH and residual pollutants. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an easy to operate ecosystem and have a long history of application in treatment of wastewaters with extreme pH, such as acid mine drainage. However, knowledge of the mechanistic details involved in the use of CWs to treat high alkaline drainage, such as stripped effluent, is insufficient. This study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of using three sub-surface horizontal flow CWs to treat high alkaline stripped effluent (pH > 10). Two intensification strategiesintermittent aeration and effluent recirculationwere evaluated to enhance nitrogen depuration performance. The results show that the treatment of alkaline stripped effluent is feasible due to the high buffering capacity of the wetlands. Effluent recirculation combined with intermittent artificial aeration improves nitrogen removal, with 71% total nitrogen (TN) removal. Ammonia volatilization from the surface of the wetlands in high alkaline conditions only contributed to 3% of the total removed ammonium. The microbial abundance and activity had significant diversity for the various enhancement strategies used in the constructed wetland systems. Anammox is an important process for nitrogen removal in CWs treating alkaline stripped effluent, and possible enhancements of this process should be investigated further.

The results showed that the optimal aeration time and aeration rate were 4 h d(-1) and 1.0 L min(-1), which could create the appropriate aerobic and anoxic regions in CWs with the greater removal of COD (97.2%), NH4+-N (98.4%) and TN (90.6%) achieved simultaneously during the experiment. The results demonstrate that the optimized intermittent aeration is reliable option to enhance the treatment performance of organics and nitrogen at a lower operating cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, artificial aeration and flow rectification were used to enhance the pollutant-removal efficiencies of free water surface (FWS) CW in treating campus wastewater. Experimental results demonstrated that, under a rather low average concentration of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD < 12.3 mg l(-1)), artificial aeration and flow rectification showed a superior potential in increasing the removal ratio of BOD from 46.7% to 68.3% on school days and from 13.2% to 46.7% on non-school days. An effective increase in ammonium -nitrogen (NH4+-N) removal from 32.9 - 54.8% to 78.2 - 78.6% was achieved. Also, great improvements in removal loading rates to 4.498 g-N d(-1) m(-2) and 1.738 g-N d(-1) m(-2) under influent loading rates of 5.750 g-N d(-1) m(-2) and 2.211 g-N d(-1) m(-2) on school days and non-school days, respectively, enlarged emerging applications of FWS CWs. It implied that artificial aeration and flow rectification increased the efficiency of land use in FWS CWs and reduced the cost of pollutant removal. No significant effects of artificial aeration on total phosphorous (TP) removal performance were observed. From the experimental results with artificial aeration and without flow rectification, it demonstrated that proper flow rectification was crucial in using aeration to improve the removal performance of FWS CWs. The resuspension of sediments that was induced by aeration worsened the removal performances of BOD and NH4+-N but improved the removal of TP by improving adsorption and sedimentation.

The main objectives of this study were 1) to determine the effect of the organic loading rate (OLR) on organic matter and nutrient removal efficiency of a pilot treatment system consisting of a series of aerated filter beds (AFBs) and electric arc furnace steel slag filters operated at different void hydraulic retention times (HRTV), 2) to validate the P-Hydroslag model as a design tool for slag filters and 3) to propose preliminary design options for fish farm sludge treatment. The 11.5 month experiment was divided into two phases: Phase 1 (P1) of 8.5 months with a low OLR to the AFB5 of 0.015 kg BOD5 m(-3) d(-1), and Phase 2 (P2) of 3 months with a high OLR of 0.5 kg BOD5 m(-3) d(-1). The results showed that the OLR affected the organic matter mineralization and nitrification efficiency of AFB5. With a low OLR and an influent COD concentration of 320 mg L-1, an average COD removal efficiency of 95% was observed while with a high OLR and an influent COD of 5400 mgL(-1), an average COD reduction of 65% was achieved. Due to the high OLR during P2, no nitrification took place probably due to the low availability of oxygen in the AFB(5). The TP removal efficiency of the AFB(5) was 50% during P1 (influent of 5.2 mg L-1), and 88% during P2 (influent of 110 mg L-1). All SCs showed a high o-PO4 removal efficiency of >98% during P1 (average influent of 1.8 mg P L-1, effluent of 0.04 mg P L-1) and >85% during P2 (average influent of 8.7 mg P L-1, effluent of 0.65 mg P L-1) with a decrease in efficiency only observed over time in the SC that received the highest organic loading rate. It was concluded that with optimal loading rates, this compact biological and physicochemical semi extensive treatment system offers a promising alternative to the high energy demand and maintenance treatment systems for organic matter and phosphorus removal, and that this treatment system could be applicable to other agro-environmental, municipal or residential effluents.

The intermittent aeration strategy not only significantly increased removal rates of organic pollutants and NH4+-N, but also successfully created aerobic conditions in the depth of 50 cm and did not change anoxic or anaerobic conditions in the depth of 80 and 110 cm resulting in high TN removal. Increasing organic pollutant loading did not affect the removal of organic pollutants and nitrogen in intermittent aerated SWISs. High removal rates of COD (95.68 +/- 0.21%-98.41 +/- 0.23%), NH4+-N (93.77 +/- 0.39%-98.06 +/- 0.16%) and TN (84.48 +/- 0.57%-94.02 +/- 0.25%) were obtained simultaneously in intermittent aerated SWISs for the organic pollutant loading from 7.4 to 29.1 g COD/(m(2) d), and significantly higher than non-aerated SWISs. Intermittent aeration boosted the growth and reproduction of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria. In the depth of 80 and 110 cm, nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NIR) activities with intermittent aeration were higher than that without aeration. The results suggest that intermittent aeration was a reliable option to achieve high nitrogen removal in SWISs, especially under high organic pollutant loading. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Pollutants removal, especially the nitrogen removal efficiency, as well as the activities, metabolism, and functional diversities of the microbial communities involved were evaluated under different conditions. NO3--N was removed in HF1 in all seasons, while it accumulated during autumn and winter in HF2. HF2 was more efficient at removing NH4+-N than HF1 in spring and summer when HRT was above 2 d. Nitrification intensity was higher in HF2, while denitrification intensity was higher in HF1. Biolog-ECO indicated that microbial diversity was higher in HF1 than in HF2, and the structure of the microbial community was more different at the back end and in the lower layer than at other places. These results were further confirmed by qPCR and 454-pyrosequencing. The relative abundances of Nitrospira were highest in back end of the upper layer in HF2, while Denitratisoma, which involves in denitrification, was mainly found in the lower layer of HF1. The results illustrated that the radial oxygen loss from P. australis and root exudates of I. pseudacorus could have an impact on the nitrogen removal efficiency by influencing the development of microbial communities.

Conventional pig manure management practices caused water contamination. Sludge treatment wetland has been evaluated to determine its potential use under Mediterranean climate aiming at a parsimonious use of water and preventing water contamination, two major steps to preserve water resources in the Mediterranean Basin. Preliminary NH4-N degradation was tested using aeration process and/or addition of commercial bacterial products. Aeration alone appeared to be sufficient to ensure nitrogen transformation of the pig manure at lab small-scale (10 L) and medium-scale (300 L). Selected plant species e.g., Carex hispida for use in the integrated constructed wetland tolerated the nitrogen content after aeration enabling their use in a treatment vertical bed.

However, problems of insufficient oxygen supply and inappropriate oxygen distribution commonly exist in traditional CWs. Detailed analyses of DO supply and distribution characteristics in different types of CWs were introduced. It can be concluded that atmospheric reaeration (AR) served as the promising point on oxygen intensification. The paper summarized possible optimizations of DO in CWs to improve its decontamination performance. Process (tidal flow, drop aeration, artificial aeration, hybrid systems) and parameter (plant, substrate and operating) optimizations are particularly discussed in detail. Since economic and technical defects are still being cited in current studies, future prospects of oxygen research in CWs terminate this review. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The high and long-term 95.6% COD, 96.1% NH4+-N and 85.8% TN removal efficiencies were achieved in experimental intermittently aerated SSF CW compared with non-aerated SSF CW. Aerated SSF CWs also exhibited the excellent removal performance when comparatively comparing with other strategies and techniques applied in CWs. In addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that associated microbial abundance significantly increased owing to intermittent aeration.

Different strategies of intermittent aeration and effluent recirculation were applied to compare their effect on nitrogen depuration performance. Additional glucose supply and iron-activated carbon based post-treatment systems were established and examined, respectively, to further remove nitrate that accumulated in the effluents from aerated wetlands. The results showed that intermittent aeration (1 h on:1 h off) significantly improved nitrification with ammonium removal efficiency of 90% (18.1 g/(m(2). d)), but limited TN removal efficiency (53%). Even though effluent recirculation (a ratio of 1:1) increased TN removal from 53% to 71%, the effluent nitrate concentration was still high. Additional glucose was used as a post-treatment option and further increased the TN removal to 82%; however, this implementation caused additional organic pollution. Furthermore, the iron-activated carbon system stimulated with a microelectrolysis process achieved greater than 85% effluent nitrate removal and resulted in 86% TN removal. Considering the high TN removal rate, aerated constructed wetlands integrated with a microelectrolysis-driven system show great potential for treating high-strength digestate supernatant.

The effect of aeration and recirculation on a sand-based hybrid constructed wetland treating low-strength domestic wastewater	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Aeration; hybrid constructed wetland; low-strength domestic wastewater; nitrogen; recirculation	ARTIFICIAL AERATION; NITROGEN REMOVAL; POLLUTANTS REMOVAL; PERFORMANCE; COMBINATION; EFFLUENT; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; PLANTS; LOAD	The Duplex-constructed wetland (CW) is a hybrid system composed of a vertical flow (VF) CW on top of a horizontal flow filter (HFF). Each compartment is designed to play a different role: aerobic treatment in the VF CW due to intermittent feeding and anoxic treatment in the HFF due to saturated conditions. Three Duplex-CWs were used in this study: Control, Aerated and Recirculating. The role of each compartment was tested for pollutant removal and micro-invertebrate abundance. In all systems, the VF CW removed mainly organic matter, solids and NH4+-N. Pathogens were removed in both compartments. Likewise, total nitrogen removal occurred in both compartments, only the Recirculating HFF was not able to denitrify the nitrogen due to the slightly more oxic conditions as compared to the other systems. All systems met discharge guidelines for organic matter, but only the Control and Aerated systems met those for total nitrogen. At the applied loading rates, the pollutant removal was not significantly enhanced by the use of aeration and recirculation. Therefore, operation as in the Control system, without aeration or recirculation, is recommended for the tested Duplex-CWs. If artificial aeration will be used in CWs, the support material should be carefully selected to allow a proper air distribution.	[Zapater-Pereyra, M.; Kyomukama, E.; Namakula, V.; van Bruggen, J. J.

While numerous investigations have been reported testing constant aeration, scarce information can be found about the efficiency of intermittent aeration. This study aims at comparing continuous and intermittent aeration, establishing if there is an optimal regime that will increase treatment efficiency of HSSFCWs whilst minimizing the energy requirement. Full and intermittent aeration were tested in a pilot plant of three HSSF CWs (2.64 m(2) each) fed with primary treated wastewater. One unit was fully aerated; one intermittently aerated (i.e. by setting a limit of 0.5 mg/L dissolved oxygen within the bed) with the remaining unit not aerated as a control. Results indicated that intermittent aeration was the most successful operating method. Indeed, the coexistence of aerobic and anoxic conditions promoted by the intermittent aeration resulted in the highest COD (66%), ammonium (99%) and total nitrogen (79%) removals. On the other hand, continuous aeration promotes ammonium removal (99%), but resulted in nitrate concentrations in the effluent of up to 27 mg/L. This study demonstrates the high potential of the intermittent aeration to increase wastewater treatment efficiency of CWs providing an extreme benefit in terms of the energy consumption.

Also considering of high toxicity of non-biodegradable and low proportion of biodegradable compounds in stabilized landfill leachate, the conventional biological treatment of nitrogen is usually inefficient. As such, the quest of this study was to revise the operational strategies of bioreactor, i.e. moving bed sequencing batch reactor (MBSBR), for the enhancement of nitrogen removal from stabilized landfill leachate. The performance of MBSBRs packed with 8% (v/v) of polyurethane (PU) cubes and polyethylene (PE) rings, respectively, in removing nitrogen from a combined stabilized landfill leachate and domestic wastewater in increasing leachate volumetric ratio under various operational strategies was investigated. On increasing the leachate volumetric ratio to 14%, the performance of both MBSBRs in NH4+-N removal was comparable under the continuous aeration strategy. When the aeration strategy was changed to intermittent aeration (IA), the MBSBR with PU media achieved a higher NH4+-N removal rate, while the MBSBR with PE media failed to remove NH4+-N completely. For the MBSBR with PU media, the adoption of IA coupled with step feeding strategy had yielded a removal efficiency of 80% for total nitrogen in comparison to 64% if only IA strategy was adopted at the leachate volumetric ratio of 14%. Nevertheless, further increase in leachate volumetric ratio to 20% had led to the accumulation of NH4+-N in the effluent of MBSBR under IA-SF strategy. At this stage, the MBSBR operated with IA strategy could still remove NH4+-N completely. Thus, the IA-MBSBR with PU media is the preferred operational strategy for nitrogen removal at higher leachate volumetric ratio.

Compared to literature, this study provided promising integrated wastewater treatment and landscape for wastewater treatment. This first-attempt study clearly deciphered interactive effect of aeration rate (AR) on nutrient removal and microbial community structure in LASeM. When AR was 0.016 m3 h 1, the most appropriate removal of COD, NH4-N and TP were 96%, 97% and 74% with the effluent of 14.3, 1.7 and 0.7 mg L 1, respectively, which showed satisfactory capabilities for rural domestic wastewater treatment. According to clone library analysis, Proteobacteria (71%), Bacteroidetes (17%) were found to be the dominant bacterial phylums present in LASeM for biodegradation. In particular, the incorporation of plants altered the microbial community and strengthened capability for the nutrients removal likely due to synergistic interactions among species in the ecosystem.

High average removal rates of 92.3% for COD, 90.2% for NH4-N and 88.1% for TN were achieved simultaneously in SWIS D compared with SWIS A, B and C. The excellent TN removal of SWIS D was due to intermittent aeration provided sufficient oxygen for nitrification in upper matrix and the favorable anoxic or anaerobic environment for denitrification in subsequent matrix, and moreover, shunt distributing wastewater provided sufficient carbon source for denitrification process. The results indicated that intermittent artificial aeration combined with shunt distributing wastewater could achieve high organics and nitrogen removal in SWISs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Hannibal gas plant, the used water is exploited from a local deep well drilled in the plant. However, before being used in both of gas process and domestic activities, this water is treated in a specified unit called "Metito Unit" to obtain an overpurified water that can meet with the chemical requirements of the oil/gas process and the health and environment standards. After several steps of the process, the polluted wastewater resulting from several activities within the plant is treated in the "Sewage Unit". This unit decontaminates wastewater from polluting factors, using the "Extended Aeration Method". We have shown that in spite of the efficient methods used in the sewage system procedure, several problems can occur during the operating of the system such as hydraulic overloading, high SVI, high Fm ratio, which causes high level of organic pollutants (BOD5 = 42 mg/l), chemical pollution (COD = 85 mg/l), high level of pH 8, chloride (1900 mg/l), and iron (8300 mg/l). We suggest that the quality of the treated wastewater should be improved by the addition of other processes such as constructed wetland process, photo-catalytic oxidation technique which is one of the most efficient methods of wastewater treatment, to produce water quality that is very similar to that of the natural waters.

High removal of 97.2% COD, 98.9% NH4+-N and 85.8% TN were obtained simultaneously in the intermittent-aerated CW system using sludge-ceramsite substrate compared with non-aerated CWs. Moreover, results from fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in the intermittent-aerated CW system with sludge-ceramsite substrate was enhanced, thus indicating that the application of intermittent aeration and sludge-ceramsite plays an important role in nitrogen transformations. These results suggest that a combination of intermittent aeration and sludge-ceramsite substrate is reliable to enhance the treatment performance in SSF CWs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Pilot scale systems were built and supplied with different intensities of aeration and corresponding controls, with supporting evidence from two full scale operational sites. Results show T. latifolia was more impacted by aeration than P. australis when comparing against their respective non-aerated controls, evidenced in reduced height, growth rate and leaf length. However, the impact was less visible due to T. latifolia's faster growth rate compared to P. australis. Micro and macronutrient uptake by each species had no discernible pattern, preventing the identification of a definitive mechanism to explain the retarded growth. However, results suggest a synergy between iron and manganese may be at play. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrification cessation and recovery in an aerated saturated vertical subsurface flow treatment wetland: Field studies and microscale biofilm modeling	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Aeration; Constructed wetland; Denitrification; Diffusion; Intensified wetland	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WATER; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; REMOVAL; OXYGEN	In aerated treatment wetlands, oxygen availability is not a limiting factor in sustaining a high level of nitrification in wastewater treatment. In the case of an air blower failure, nitrification would cease, potentially causing adverse effects to the nitrifying bacteria. A field trial was completed investigating nitrification loss when aeration is switched off, and the system recovery rate after the aeration is switched back on. Loss of dissolved oxygen was observed to be more rapid than loss of nitrification. Nitrate was observed in the effluent long after the aeration was switched off (48 h+). A complementary modeling study predicted nitrate diffusion out of biofilm over a 48 h period. After two weeks of no aeration in the established system, nitrification recovered within two days, whereas nitrification establishment in a new system was previously observed to require 20-45 days. These results suggest that once established resident nitrifying microbial communities are quite robust. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Artificial aeration was conducted based on simulating photovoltaic aeration. The increase in OLR promoted the removal performances for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen ( [GRAPHICS] -N) in TF, which could be up to 95.7 and 97.2%, respectively, under OLR of 751.2g/m(2)d. Excess organic carbons inhibited [GRAPHICS] -N removal through competition for oxygen available in VF, where the COD removal efficiency could be 89.6% while low [GRAPHICS] -N removal (40%) was obtained under OLR 751.2g/m(2)d. With the increase in OLR, the removal of total nitrogen (TN) was enhanced. A higher OLR can not only provide enough electron donors but also produce more anoxic regions for denitrification. The best TN removal was 77.5% in TF and 49.8% in VF, which occurred at OLR of 751.2 and 602.4g/m(2)d, respectively. A drop of TN removal in VF was attributed to the lack of nitrate-nitrogen ( [GRAPHICS] -N) when reaching OLR of 751.2g/m(2)d. The removal efficiency for total phosphorus was increased gradually with the increase in OLR. This paper suggests that appropriate control of OLR can achieve the optimal effect of pollutants removal, especially the elimination of TN.

Nitrification of non-aerated SWISs was poor due to oxygen deficiency while higher COD/N ratios further led to lower COD and nitrogen removal rate. Intermittent aeration achieved almost complete nitrification, which successfully created aerobic conditions in the depth of 50 cm and did not change anoxic or anaerobic conditions in the depth of 80 and 110 cm. The sufficient carbon source in high COD/N ratio influent greatly promoted denitrification in SWISs with intermittent aeration. High average removal rates of COD (95.68%), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) (99.32%) and total nitrogen (TN) (89.65%) were obtained with influent COD/N ratio of 12 in aerated SWISs. The results suggest that intermittent aeration was a reliable option to achieve high nitrogen removal in SWISs, especially with high COD/N ratio wastewater.

We studied the treatment of wastewater from a potato farm in Ontario, Canada, using a system of pretreatment (sedimentation, aeration) followed by a surface-flow wetland with a dense growth of cattails (Typha sp.). The raw wastewater had high average concentrations of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5; 1113 mgL(-1)), total suspended solids (TSS; 4338 mgL(-1)), total nitrogen (TN; 311 mgL(-1)) and total phosphorus (TP; 42.5 mgL(-1)). Due to high influent loads, the pretreatment was enlarged during annual sediment cleaning at the end of Year 1 (Y1), which increased the hydraulic retention time and delayed the seasonal onset of wetland loading from winter in Y1 to spring in Year 2 (Y2). Total concentration reduction for the treatment system (pretreatment + wetland) in Y2 was 96% BOD5, 99% TSS, 86% TN and 90% TP; and in Y1 was 79% BOD5, 97% TSS, 62% TN and 54% TP. Overall, the best treatment in both the pretreatment and the wetland was seen in spring months. The enlarged pretreatment system enabled seasonal loading of the wetland during the spring and summer, which facilitated improved treatment performance.

An increase in the COD/N ratio led to increased reductions in NO3 and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) in planted and unplanted wetlands, but diminished removal of NH4. The HSSFCW planted with Canna indica L. exhibited a significant reduction in NH4 compared to the unplanted system, particularly in the active root zone where NH4 removal performance increased by up to 26 % at the COD/N ratio of 8:1. There was no significant difference in NO3 removal between the planted and unplanted wetlands. TIN removal efficiency in the planted wetland increased with COD/N ratios, which was likely influenced by plant uptake. NH4 reductions were greater in planted wetland at the 20- and 40-cm depths while NO3 reductions were uniformly greater with depth in all cases, but no statistical difference was impacted by depth on TIN removal. These findings show that planting a HSSFCW can provide some benefit in reducing nitrogen loads in effluents, but only when a sufficient carbon source is present.

According to findings, the effect of interspecific competition was notable for Phragmites australis, whereby it showed the highest growth performance in both FWS and SSF wetland. In a mixed-culture, P. australis demonstrates superiority in terms of competitive interactions for space between plants. Furthermore, the interspecific competition among planted species seemed to cause different ecological responses of plant species in the two CWs. For example, while relatively high density and shoot height determined the high aboveground dry weight of P. australis in the FWS wetland, this association was not evident in the SSF. Additionally, while plants nutrients uptake accounts for a higher proportion of the nitrogen removal in FWS, that in the SSF accounts for a higher proportion of the phosphorous removal.

Three laboratory-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (CWs; planted+aeration, planted, and unplanted) were set up to investigate the feasibility of liquid digestate treatment in wetlands. Treatment capacity in different wetlands was evaluated under different influent concentrations (chemical oxygen demand [COD], 5 days biochemical oxygen demand [BOD5], and nitrogen forms). The effect of aeration and effluent recirculation on organic matter and total nitrogen removal was investigated. Results showed that integrating intermittent aeration in CWs significantly improved the oxygen condition (p < 0.01) in the wetland bed and promoted BOD5 removal to 90% in aerated CWs as compared with <15% in the unaerated CWs. Meanwhile, COD removal between these three wetlands did not show any difference and varied from 52 to 72% under influent concentration of 200-820mg/L because of the high content of hard-degradable organic matter in the liquid digestate. Intermittent aeration resulted in high ammonium removal (>98%) although the influent loading varied from 65 to 350mg/L. However, intermittent aeration caused nitrate accumulation of 300mg/L and limited total nitrogen (TN) removal of 33%. To intensify the TN removal, we verified effluent recirculation to increase the removal efficiency of TN to 78%. These results not only show the potential application of CWs for treatment of high-strength liquid anaerobic digested slurry, but also indicate the significance of intermittent aeration on the enhanced removal of organic matter and ammonium.

A locally isolated microalga, Chlorella sp., was grown to determine the effect of temperature, aeration rate, and cultivation time on simultaneous biomass production and nutrient removal from piggery wastewater using central composite design (CCD). The most important variable for the biomass productivity of Chlorella sp. was aeration rate, while that for lipid content and nutrient removal efficiency was cultivation time. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies were higher than that of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from piggery wastewater. The CCD results indicate that the highest biomass productivity (79.2 mg L-1 d(-1)) and simultaneous nutrient removal efficiency (TN 80.9%, TP 99.2%, COD 74.5%) were obtained with a cultivation temperature of 25 degrees C, a cultivation time of 5 days, and an air aeration rate of 1.6 L L-1 min(-1). Palmitic acid (C16:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2) were both abundant in Chlorella sp. cells under mixotrophic cultivation with piggery wastewater.

In this study, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and pakchoi (Brassica chinensis) were cultured in lab-scale aquaponics, and attempts were conducted to enhance its nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) through two optimization methods, i.e., nitrifies addition (NA) and filler gradation (FG). Results showed that NA and FG could improve the NUE of aquaponics by 8.8 and 16.0 %, respectively, compared with control. The total ammonia (TAN) and nitrite (NO2 (-)) concentrations in NA and FG systems were maintained at relatively low level (TAN < 0.5 mg/L, NO2 (-) < 0.1 mg/L), which demonstrated that both the NA and FG could provide non-toxic water environment for fish culture. Nitrous oxide conversion ratio of the control, NA, and FG were 0.8, 1.2, and 1.7 %, respectively, indicating that media-based aquaponics also contributed to global warming. Although the two proposed attempts in this study caused more N2O emission, they made new breakthrough in improving the NUE of aquaponics.

To increase the HLR, an innovative SWIS was developed using cyclic operation mode. In each cycle, a wastewater feeding period is followed by a drying period, in which the aeration is conducted by a medium-pressure fan. Results indicated that the removal rate of TOC and NH4+-N were more than 85% at HLR of 0.5 m(3)/m(2) d, whereas the TN removal rate was lower than 20%, indicating that the aeration was efficient and denitrification process was largely limited in the SWIS. When HLR decreased from 0.5 to 0.2 m(3)/m(2) d, the pollutant removal efficiency enhanced slightly except for TN. Overall, the intermittent operation and micro-power aeration, combined with shunting the pollutant loading were really helpful for SWIS to achieve higher HLR, which offers a reference for the design of innovative SWIS.

Commercial biochemical treatment units are important parts of HOPW treatment processes, but many are not in stable operation because of the toxic and refractory substances, salt, present. Therefore, pilot-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrolytic acidification-biological filter with airlift aeration (HA-BFAA), a novel HOPW treatment system. Four strains isolated from oily sludge were used for bioaugmentation to enhance the biodegradation of organic pollutants. The isolated bacteria were evaluated using 3-day biochemical oxygen demand, oil, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals as evaluation indices. Bioaugmentation enhanced the COD removal by 43.5 mg/L under a volume load of 0.249 kg COD/m(3) day and hydraulic retention time of 33.6 h. The effluent COD was 70.9 mg/L and the corresponding COD removal was 75.0 %. The optimum volumetric air-to-water ratio was below 10. The removal ratios of the total extractable organic pollutants, alkanes, and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons were 71.1, 94.4, and 94.0 %, respectively. Results demonstrated that HA-BFAA was an excellent HOPW treatment system.

The tested factors were (i) ratio of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) (abbreviation B/C) in the influent, (ii) aeration position, (iii) aeration intensity (expressed as air/water ratio), and (iv) hydraulic residence time (HRT). Results showed that the sequence and degree of the influence of the tested factors were HRT** > aeration intensity** > aeration position* > B/C for CODCr. removal, HRT** > aeration position* approximate to aeration intensity* > B/C for ammonia (NH4+-N) removal, HRT** > B/C** > aeration position** > aeration intensity** for total nitrogen (TN) removal and HRT** > aeration intensity > aeration position B/C for total phosphorus (TP) removal (* denotes significant influence (0.01 <p < 0.05) and ** denotes extremely significant influence (p <= 0.01)). Although the optimal operating conditions for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP removal in the system were quite different from each other, the comprehensive optimal operating conditions (B/C approximate to 0.30, surface aeration, aeration intensity = 3:1, HRT = 2.0d) obtained by the comprehensive balance method for the operation of the whole system proved to be feasible and practicable, under which the average concentration removal percentages were 80.81%, 75.97%, 82.38% and 80.95% for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP, respectively. Moreover, the wetland columns accounted for the greatest removal of pollutants in the combined system, while the oxidation pond conferred a buffer capacity to the system by allowing for high loading fluctuations and pre-treated the influent as well. This study also offers references for the analysis of the results of the multi-index orthogonal test. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The FCW system included a tank for accommodating collected water and a floating mat with media, to support the growth of two macrophyte species Phragmites australis and Canna indica. Mean mass removal rates of 0.66, 0.76, 0.08, 0.51, 2.49 g/m(2) d were achieved for ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4-N), total inorganic nitrogen (TIN), phosphorus (P), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand,(COD), respectively by the FCW. Nitrogen removal was via nitrification-denitrification processes, whereas filtration-sedimentation appeared to influence phosphorus removal. The system achieved substantial Escherichia coli mortality rates, through protozoa predation and oxidation processes. Higher influent concentrations during dry period allowed greater removal of nutrients and E. coli. Hydraulic shock-loading experiment revealed critical interdependency between hanging roots maturity, input hydraulic, and pollutant loadings for maintaining stable performances.

The experiment was carried out in three phases A, B and C consisting of different NB loading and glucose dosing. For each phase, the effect of aeration was assessed by intermittently aerating one wetland and leaving one unaerated. Regardless of whether or not the wetland was aerated, at an influent NB concentration of 140 mg/L, both wetlands significantly reduced NB to less than 2 mg/L, a reduction efficiency of 98%. However, once the influent NB concentration was increased to 280 mg/L, the aerated wetland had a higher removal performance 82% compared to that of the unaerated wetland 71%. Addition of glucose further intensified the NB removal to 95% in the aerated wetlands and 92% in the unaerated. Aeration of wetlands enhanced NB degradation, but also resulted in higher NB volatilization of 6 mg m(-2) d(-1). The detected high concentration of sulphide 20-60 mg/L in the unaerated wetland gave a strong indication that NB may act as an electron donor to sulphate-reducing bacteria, but this should be further investigated. Aeration positively improved NB removal in constructed wetlands, but resulted in higher NB volatilization. Glucose addition induced co-metabolism to enhance NB degradation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It analyzed the removal of organic matters and nitrogen, the status of a wetland by depth, and microbial communities under the conditions of aeration and non-aeration at the inlet section, and planting and non-planting. The results of this study show that aeration at the inlet section and planting affect ORP, , and nitrogen by water flowing distance and water depth in a wetland. The result of CODcr removal seems to satisfy the Korean standard (below 20mg/L (CODmn)) of reuse water quality in all three operational conditions. The aeration at the inlet section has the advantages of effectively removing organic matters at the inlet section, thus preventing its clogging, and removing nitrogen through the nitrification. Aeration at the inlet section and planting are expected to have a positive effect on the wetland status and GW treatment. Therefore, aeration at the inlet and planting will be helpful to construct and operate an artificial wetland in residential areas such as a multi-family housing complex. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria including Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Nitrosococcus and denitrifying or nitrate-reducing bacteria such as Thiobacillus, Achromobacter, Pseudomonas, Micrococcus belong to the classes of -proteobacteria, -proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. These microbial communities found in this study seem to contribute to nitrogen removal. But, the roles of microbial community in CWs need to be further investigated, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

The novel concomitant assessment of diurnal dynamics of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations under field conditions tests the whole-system interactions in plant-internal gas exchange and regulation. Oxygen concentrations ([O-2]) were monitored in-situ in central culm and rhizome pith cavities of common reed (Phragmites australis) using optical oxygen sensors. The corresponding carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]) were assessed via gas samples from the culms. Highly dynamic diurnal courses of [O-2] were recorded, which started at 6.5-13 % in the morning, increased rapidly up to 22 % during midday and declined exponentially during the night. Internal [CO2] were high in the morning (1.55-17.5 %) and decreased (0.04-0.94 %) during the rapid increase of [O-2] in the culms. The observed negative correlations between [O-2] and [CO2] particularly describe the below ground relationship between plant-mediated oxygen supply and oxygen use by respiration and biogeochemical processes in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, the nocturnal declining slopes of [O-2] in culms and rhizomes indicated a down-regulation of the demand for oxygen in the complete below ground plant-associated system. These findings emphasize the need for measurements of plant-internal gas exchange processes under field conditions because it considers the complex interactions in the oxic-anoxic interface.

Vegetation characteristics, including photosynthetically active radiation, transpiration ratio and stomatal conductance were also monitored before and after regulation measures implemented. The temperature-proof measures in low winter improved the sludge activity, vegetation characteristics and rhizosphere microorganism function, which helped the effluent COD and NH4+-N meet Chinese wastewater discharge standards stably. By increased the sludge recirculation ratio from 0.5 to 0.75 to resist organic loading rate shocking, the pollutions removal as well as the vegetation activities were improved greatly. As for the instable aeration intensity in varied unit, switch between continuous feeding and pulse feeding effectively enhanced the NH4 (+)-N removal capability.

The effects of 5 substrates (furnace slag, building rubbish, coarse sand, anthracite, and granular activated carbon) on water pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), NH4+-N, NO3--N, and total phosphorus (TP) were studied under 4 hydraulic loadings (0.35, 0.5, 0.7, and 2.1 m(3)/(m(2).d)) by a small-scale field experiment, total experimental treatment was 20. Results showed that after flowing through tested substrates, effluent pH value generally increased by within 21.6%, and EC was varied within 15.2% compared with raw sewage water. The 41.5% - 82.4% of turbidity was removed for all tested substrates under the low hydraulic loadings less than 0.7 m(3)/(m(2).d) but its removal was not effective when hydraulic loading was 2.1m(3)/(m(2).d). All tested substrates could remove CODCr by different degrees but its removal efficiency generally was not significant. The removal efficiency on NH4+-N averagely was 16.9%, 22.9%, 21.5%, 26.4%, and 37.0%, respectively, for furnace slag, building rubbish, coarse sand, anthracite, and activated carbon, and it generally decreased with the increase of hydraulic loadings. Of NH4+-N in the raw sewage water, averagely 27.4%, 37.0%, 42.4%, and 52.3% were removed by furnace slag, coarse sand, anthracite, and activated carbon, respectively. The removal efficiency of furnace slag, building rubbish, and coarse sand on TP was 31.5%, 34.5%, and 43.5%, respectively, and it generally decreased with the increased hydraulic loadings. When to design a sewage land treatment system, substrate type should be chosen based on major pollutant type and hydraulic loading be determined according to expected removal efficiency.

The results showed that a favorable removal effect of nitrogen could be obtained through constructed wetland. Moreover, the aeration device added to the bottom could increase the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen in lightly polluted wastewater, but the removal of total nitrogen was not satisfactory under this operational condition. In addition, when the bottom aeration device was added, the optimal operation condition was evaluated by three-dimensional (2D and 3D) contour plots. The results showed that in a horizontal zeolite subsurface constructed wetland (HZSW), the optimal removal rates for ammonia nitrogen (which could reach above 98%) were obtained when the average daily aeration time was about 7-17 h and hydraulic loadings were 0.05-0.20 m(3)/(m(2).d). Meanwhile, the optimal removal rates of total nitrogen could reach 56.40-62.60% when the average daily aeration time was less than 5 h and the hydraulic loadings were less than 0.11 m(3)/(m(2).d). In contrast, in a horizontal limestone subsurface constructed wetland (HLSW) the optimal removal rates of ammonia nitrogen (namely 96.44-97.10%) could be obtained when the average daily aeration time was more than 11 h and hydraulic loadings were about 0.10-0.45 m(3)/(m(2).d); meanwhile, the optimal removal effects of total nitrogen, namely 49.25-55.00%, were obtained when the average daily aeration time was less than 8.5 h and the hydraulic loadings were less than 0.13 m(3)/(m(2).d). In summary, the removal effects of ammonia nitrogen increased obviously and that of total nitrogen were depressed apparently after the bottom aeration device was added.

The bio-filter was packed with 'dolochar', a sponge iron industry waste, as an adsorbent mainly for phosphate removal through a physicochemical approach. The denitrifying bio-reactor was packed with many waste organic solid substances (WOSS) as carbon sources and substrates for biomass attachment, mainly to remove nitrate in the biological denitrification process. The performance of the modular system, treating real domestic wastewater was monitored for a period of about 60 days and the average removal efficiencies during the period were as follows: phosphate, 99.48%; nitrate, 92.44%, ammonia, 96.64%, with mean final effluent concentration of 0.153, 5.5, and 1.06 mg L-1, respectively. This treatment system would allow multipurpose reuse of the final effluent. Moreover, the saturated dolochar can be used as a nutrient supply in agricultural practices and the partially degraded carbonaceous substances can also be used as an organic fertilizer after composting. Thus, the system displays immense potential for treating domestic wastewater significantly by decreasing the concentrations of nutrient and most importantly, facilitating the conversion of the waste materials into usable ones.

Two lines of Mesocosm Constructed Wetland (MCW) were installed: (a) gravel line (i.e. G-Line) and (b) zeolite line (i.e. Z-Line). Aeration increased the NH4+-N removal efficiency by 20-45% in the G-Line. Natural zeolite increased the NH4+-N removal efficiency by up to 60% in the Z-Line. Plants contributed 15-30% of the NH4+-N removal efficiency and no difference between the G-Line and the Z-Line. Conversely, the NH4+-N removal rate was shown to only increase with the use of natural zeolite. However, the MCW with natural zeolite, the NH4+-N removal rate showed a direct relationship only with the NH4+-N influent concentration. Additionally, relationship between the oxygen, energy and area regarding the NH4+-N removal efficiency was established for 2.5-12.5 gO(2)/(kWh-m(2)) in the G-Line and 0.1-2.6 gO(2)/(kWh-m(2)) in the Z-Line. Finally, it was established that a combination of natural zeolite as a support medium and the aeration strategy in a single CW could regenerate the zeolite's adsorption sites and maintain a given NH4+-N removal efficiency over time.

Sawdust and grass powders were added in the anaerobic stage (ANS) to provide organic carbon sources for the denitrification process, and the reduction environment was improved by iron addition in the ANS. Aerobic respiration and nitrification primarily occurred in the upper aerobic stage (AES), which removed 86.68% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 91.80% of the NH4+-N. Moreover, heterotrophic denitrification occurred in the bottom ANS when added sawdust and grass powders were used as a carbon source. Overall, the TSISHD showed remarkable removal efficiencies of 88.29%, 82.50%, 92.05%, and 78.10% for COD, NO3--N,NH4+-N, and total phosphorus, respectively, and the corresponding effluent concentrations met the national quality standard of China for class V surface water. The removal efficiencies were significantly higher than those of the previous soil infiltration systems without inoculated microbes. The developed system has the potential to treat urban runoff.

However, there is a debate about the importance of vegetation for wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands. The amounts of pollutants taken up by plants are generally low. However, plants can stimulate pollutant removal by the release of root oxygen. As one oxygen source (others may include inflow carrying of oxygen and aeration), the role of plants in pollutant removal remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of the "dischargeable oxygen release rate" on organic matter and nitrogen removal using an "in-situ test" method. In addition, the constructed wetlands were operated in a conventional way, with several oxygen sources playing a role, including inflow carrying of oxygen, aeration and oxygen release from the roots of plants. The maximum rates of dischargeable oxygen release were 23.7 mu mol/g.h and 72.7 mu mol/g.h at hydraulic loading rates of 6.8 mm/h and 17.0 mm/h, respectively. The percentage contributions of plant roots to BOD5 removal were 0-18.2% and 1.2-24.8%, respectively, at the two hydraulic loading rates. For nitrogen removal, the corresponding percentage ranges were 0.4-21.7% and 4.0-23.5%, respectively. Therefore, the role of vegetation should not be ignored in the process of wastewater purification in constructed wetlands. Root oxygen release and pollutant removal were influenced by light and hydraulic loading rates.

The aboveground plant biomass is usually harvested to remove pollutants absorbed in plant tissues. However, the effect of plant harvesting during summer on the performance of constructed wetlands and microbial abundance is unclear. In this study, three types of microcosms were set up, including: cleared group (both shoots and roots were harvested), harvested group (only shoots were harvested) and unharvested group. The concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand in the effluent of the harvested group were the lowest. The nitrogen mass balance showed that summer harvesting improved nitrogen absorbance by plants, which was 1.24-times higher than that in the unharvested group. Interestingly, the other losses were taken up by the highest amounts in the cleared group, which were 1.66- and 3.72-times higher than in the unharvested and harvested group, respectively. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that harvesting of shoots during summer increased the microbial abundance. Additionally, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum among all bacteria according to pyrosequencing analysis. These results indicate that harvesting of shoots during summer has positive effects on pollutant removal and microbial abundance.

However, selecting the one that can be more appreciated for on-site sanitation is still uncertain. This paper reviews the role of plants, media materials, microorganisms, and oxygen transfer in domestic wastewater purification through constructed wetlands (CWs). The effectiveness of traditional and recently developed CWs and the necessity of an induced biofilm attachment surface (BAS) in these systems for the treatment of domestic sewage are presented. This review also elucidates the idea of CWs for domestic wastewater characteristics highly stressed by total dissolved solids and the adaptive strategies in mitigating the cold climate impacts on their efficiencies. Further research needed to enhance the stability and sustainability of CWs is highlighted. By a more advanced investigation, BAS CWs can be specified as an ideal treatment process in decentralization.

This study assesses the seasonal performance of 4 different full-scale wastewater technologies that have been used in small communities (<2000 population equivalent) for more than 10 years in terms of emerging contaminant (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and NH4-N removal efficiency. The studied technologies, which were selected due to their widespread use, included two intensive treatment systems (an extended aeration system (AS) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC)) and two extensive treatment systems (a constructed wetland (CW) and a waste stabilization pond (WSP)), all located in northeastern Spain. The studied compounds belonged to the groups of pharmaceuticals, sunscreen compounds, fragrances, antiseptics, flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides and plasticizers. The 25 ECs occurred in wastewater at concentrations ranging from undetectable to 80 mu g L-1. The average removal efficiency was 42% for the CW, 62% for the AS, 63% for the RBC and 82% for the WSP. All the technologies except the WSP system showed seasonal variability in the removal of ECs. The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that, whilst all the technologies were capable of decreasing the aquatic risk, only the WSP yielded no risk in both seasons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Previously only mechanical treatment systems involving forced aeration with subsequent disinfection, usually by tablet-chlorination, had been accredited in Australia. The modular design of the hybrid, subsurface-flow reedbed system offered 5 control points where monitoring and management of the treatment train could be carried out. Ten chemical parameters (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen percentage saturation and suspended solids) and 4 microbial parameters (total coliform, Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens) reached satisfactory levels as a result of the treatment process. Health requirements for safe horticultural irrigation were met by the outlet of the second reedbed, providing a high level of treatment-backup capacity in terms of the remaining 2 reedbeds. This suggested that chlorination was a redundant backup precaution in treating irrigation water to the acceptable regional guideline level for all horticultural uses, including the spray irrigation of salad crops eaten raw.

This study evaluates effects of seasonal variations, wetland age, supplemental aeration and design connected in-series on BOD5 and TSS treatment performances of CWs. Aerated CWs achieved higher BOD5 and TSS treatment efficiencies by 8% and 5% respectively, compared with non-aerated ones. The performances of the CWs increased with increasing age, and in the best growing seasons (between April and September) of the plants. The utilization of in-series design increased BOD5 and TSS removal efficiencies by 12% and 16%, respectively. In conclusions, the high treatment efficiency achieved by average 83% for BOD5 and 90% for TSS presented that the CWs had a high potential as an appropriate technology for daisy farm effluents in cold climates.

Comparative study of cold-climate constructed wetland technology in Canada and northern China for water resource protection	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS			English	Review						ecologically engineered systems; constructed wetlands; cold climate; water resource protection; Canada; northern China	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; LIVESTOCK WASTE-WATER; OIL-PRODUCED WATER; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; POLLUTANT REMOVAL; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; PLANTS; PERFORMANCE; MUNICIPAL; SYSTEMS	This paper aims to be a cursory relative comparison between applications of custom-designed constructed wetland systems for specific water resources protection in Canada and northern China. Comparing constructed wetlands can be difficult and at times misleading; they are custom built to deal with specific target wastewater at specific locations and differ not only in physical shape and dimension, but in vegetation cover, hydraulic retention time, and pollutant loading rates. Treatment efficiencies defined by the Canadian and northern Chinese experience vary considerably. Experience in both countries shows that the majority of effluent values are generally better than those required by discharge standards in Canada and China. Examples provided from both countries demonstrated that plants can play a role in constructed wetland systems and make a difference in treatment efficiency. A review of the available case studies on cold weather treatment in both countries indicates that this technology is feasible in Canada and northern China, although further monitoring data are needed to optimize wetland design and ensure that the effluent quality standards are consistently met. Constructed wetland systems in both countries have an apparent advantage in construction costs, and the costs for treatment and operation and maintenance of these systems are much lower than those of conventional wastewater treatment plants. Land requirements for constructed wetlands present one of the factors most limiting their broader use, especially in China, where land resources are scarce and population density is high.

Most of these STPs are denounced owing to failures on several fronts including design, operation and maintenance, installation and monitoring. A comprehensive review and evaluation of STPs was timely, in order to derive sound conclusions and recommendations for future wastewater management strategies. The objective of the present study was to conduct an independent evaluation of already existing decentralized STPs in South India. The technologies assessed were Aerated lagoon (AL), Extended aeration (EA), Anaerobic filter/Vortex put forward by Centre for Scientific Research (CSR VORTEX), Constructed Wetland (DEWATS others), Membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Moving bed Biofilm reactor (MBBR). Among the various technologies evaluated, MBR exhibited the highest total COD, BOD and solids removal efficiency. Pathogen count was lowest in MBR, followed by MBBR and AL. Nutrient removal in terms of ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen was highest in DEWATS. Effective hours of continuous operation enabled improved plant performance. In case of natural treatment technology such as DEWATS, energy requirement is quite low, whereas conventional treatment technologies such as EA necessitate considerably high demand of energy, requiring few personnel to operate the system. Innovative high cell density systems such as MBBR and MBR entail significant power consumption and elaborate maintenance, requiring large number of skilled professionals. The major reasons for failure of STPs were related to mechanical, electrical and labour problems. Regular monitoring and maintenance is required with due diligence in all the treatment technologies for proper functioning.

Results showed that middle aeration allowed the CW to possess more uniform oxygen distribution and to achieve greater removals of COD and NH3-N, while the CW under bottom aeration and surface aeration demonstrated more distinct stratification of oxygen distribution and surface aeration brought about better TN removal capacity for the OP-CW system. However, no significant influence of artificial aeration or AP on TP removal was observed. Overall, AP could significantly affect the spatial distribution of dissolved oxygen by influencing the oxygen diffusion paths in aerated CWs, thereby influencing the removal of pollutants, especially organics and nitrogen, which offers a reference for the design of aerated CWs.

Nitrogen and COD Removal from Septic Tank Wastewater in Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetlands: Plants Effects	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						constructed wetlands; biofilms; wastewater treatment	RHIZOSPHERE; SYSTEMS	We evaluated subsurface flow (SSF) constructed wetland treatment performance with respect to organics (COD) and nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) removal from domestic (septic tank) wastewater as affected by the presence of plants, substrate "rock'' cation exchange capacity (CEC), laboratory versus field conditions and use of synthetic as compared to actual domestic wastewater. This article considers the effects of plants on constructed wetland treatment in the field. Each constructed wetland system was comprised of two beds (2.6 m long by 0.28 m wide and deep filled with similar to 18 mm crushed lava rock) separated by an aeration tank connected in series. The lava rock had a porosity of similar to 47% and a CEC of 4 meq/100 gm. One pair of constructed wetland systems was planted with cattails in May 2008, while an adjacent pair of systems remained unplanted. Collected septic tank or synthesized wastewater was allowed to gravity feed each constructed wetland system and effluent samples were regularly collected and tested for COD and nitrogen species during four time periods spanning November 2008 through June 2009. These effluent concentrations were tested for statistical differences at the 95% level for individual time periods as well as the overall 6-month period. Organics removal from domestic wastewater was 78.8% and 76.1% in the planted and unplanted constructed wetland systems, respectively, while ammonium removal was 94.5% and 90.2%, respectively. Similarly, organics removal from the synthetic wastewater of equivalent strength was 88.8% and 90.1% for planted and unplanted constructed wetland systems, respectively, while ammonium removal was 96.9% and 97.3%, respectively.

Characterization of a macrophyte microcosm as a surface water treatment system for antibiotics	ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						natural water treatment systems; phytoremediation; antibiotics; biomass	WASTE-WATER; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; VETERINARY ANTIBIOTICS; EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; PISTIA-STRATIOTES; HELIANTHUS-ANNUUS; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; OXYTETRACYCLINE; PLANTS	Natural water treatment systems provide for a means to manage nutrient (and carbon) cycles while improving water quality. We present chemical engineering design characteristics from an example flow through and model tertiary water treatment microcosm. This research demonstrates that aquatic macrophytes (Pistia stratiotes and Eichhornia crasippes) can degrade concentrations (0-10 mg/L) of oxytetracycline (OTC). First order OTC degradation rate coefficients (0.07-4.5/day) can be adjusted by altering; agitation, pH, temperature, and aeration mass flows in exudate treatment strategies when simulated wastewater was fed at 10 L/day. Further, we suggest that electronic paramagnetic resonance can be used to aid in hypothesis testing that external elicitation with phytohormones can be used to promote biological based oxidative bursts with methyl jasmonate during water treatment. Finally, we suggest there is a lack of research that considers macrophytes in more holistic natural and human use cycles.

J	Kirui, WK; Wu, SB; Lei, M; Dong, RJ				Kirui, Wesley K.; Wu, Shubiau; Lei, Ming; Dong, Renjie			Nitrobenzene degradation pathways and their interaction with sulfur and nitrogen transformations in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Aeration; Nitrobenzene degradation; Nitrogen; Sulfur	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ACID-MINE DRAINAGE; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; GRANULAR SLUDGE; BIODEGRADATION; REACTOR; NITRIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; DYNAMICS	Nitrobenzene (NB) degradation pathways and their interaction with sulfur and nitrogen transformations in constructed wetlands are not fully understood. This study investigates the effectiveness of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSFCWs) in NB biodegradation including the biodegradation pathways and microbial interactions. The investigation was based on two laboratory-scale wetlands planted with Juncus effusus. One wetland was intermittently aerated while the other was not. Data about NB degradation were collected at varying influent loading rates [35 and 140 mg/L] for 120-day period. From the results, both wetlands exhibited an overall performance of 99% NB removal. More so, intermittent aeration did not significantly improve overall performance but rather it enhanced the buffer capacity of NB degradation to shock influent loading. The result also demonstrates that NB mineralization account for about 96% and 4% for volatilization. Formation of ammonium from NB degradation increased the ammonium concentration in the pore water. In unaerated wetland, 84 mg/L of sulfide accumulated from complex microbial reaction involving sulfate as electron acceptor and NB as electron donor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Constructed wetland; Wood leachate; COD; Aeration	LOG YARD RUNOFF; FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; WOODWASTE LEACHATE; STORMWATER RUNOFF; WOOD; TOXICITY; STORAGE; VARIABILITY; OZONE	This study investigated the effects of aeration and/or vegetation in experimental constructed wetlands (CWs) as mesocosms on the removal of pollutants in oak wood leachate. Twelve outdoor wetland mesocosms, with randomized replicated treatment combinations of vegetation (Phragmites australis) and aeration was monitored during the second and third year after construction. The investigation included control tanks with no aeration and no vegetation. The parameters monitored were polyphenols (PPs), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and water colour. The reduction of COD after 28 days was approx. 50% and more than 50% of PPs, whereas only 40% of the water colour was removed. Aeration increased the effect of both COD and PP removal. The vegetation treatment had a small but significant effect on removal of COD. The vegetation + aeration treatment, as well as aeration alone, increased the removal efficiency of COD from 9.5 g m(-3) d(-1) in the control to 11 g m(-3) d(-1). The results suggest that CWs can be used to treat stormwater contaminated by oak wood leachate. Further, it is suggested that the main processes for removal of pollutants in the leachate occur in the open-water habitat and that the hydraulic retention time is more important for removal than aeration and vegetation related processes.

Results revealed that lower CL (less than 13.9 g COD/m(3) d) and ACL (less than 2.8 g NH4+-N/m(3) d) or a C/N ratio exceeding five was required to reduce NO3-N accumulation and NO/N2O emission. Integrated analyses indicated that the coupling of simultaneous nitrification, anammox and denitrification processes (SNAD) were the primary reason accounted for the enhanced NH4+-N treatment performance. NH4+-N removal pathways can be ranked as follows: nitrification (amoA, archaeal) (54.6%) > partial denitrification (nirS, nirK) and anammox (37.8%) > anammox and partial denitrification (narG, napA) (12.6%). Specifically, NH4+-N removal was significantly inhibited by NO2-N accumulation in the system (-21.6% inhibition). Results from stepwise regression analysis suggested that the NH4+ removal rate was collectively controlled by amoA, archaeal, anammox, nirS, nirK, narG and napA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this research, we used the natural soil (Oxisol) mixed with medium sand, planted with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and a control without plants. The objective was to evaluate the BOD removal through the immobilization of microbial biomass, basal respiration (microbial activity) and total organic carbon of the soil. We used three systems, operating with hydraulic application rates of 4, 8 e 15 cm. d-1. Each system had three units constructed wetlands and three controls, which were fed with sewage, with vertical flow unsaturated conditions, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, leaving the system with no feed on the rest of the days, for soil aeration. The results showed the soils were able to reduce significantly the BOD concentration, with removal efficiency ranging between 97 and 99%. The removal was due to the mineralization of organic matter and its accumulation in the soil. During the system start up operation, there was reduction in native soil organic matter, which started to increase gradually by the sewage application. The activity of microbial decomposers increased proportionally to the rate of sewage application, but high rates showed a trend to inhibition of this activity. In soils units controls showed minor loss of CO2 to the atmosphere, indicating a higher carbon immobilization in soils.

In this study, influent and effluent were sampled monthly for the analyses of dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen and nitrate. Results showed that removal rates of BOD, SS and NH3-N ranged 85-95% (averaged 90%), 70-95% (averaged 85%), and 70-90% (averaged 80%), respectively. Therefore, the gravel contact oxidation system is quite effective in pollution control for combined sewage and rainwater. However, microbial denitrification was not effective due to high concentrations of dissolved oxygen in non-aeration zones of the gravel contact oxidation treatment system. Although the concentration of NH3-N decreased quickly, nitrogen was not removed by microbial degradation. It was only a migration process among different forms of nitrogen. It is, therefore, important to effectively control aeration in the front zone of the gravel contact oxidation treatment system to improve the removal efficiency of total nitrogen.

Recently, the use of various modified CWs to improve treatment performance has also been reported in the literature. However, the available knowledge on various CW technologies considering the intensified and reliable removal of pollutants is still limited. Hence, this paper aims to provide an overview of the current development of CW strategies and techniques for enhanced wastewater treatment. Basic information on configurations and characteristics of different innovations was summarized. Then, overall treatment performance of those systems and their shortcomings were further discussed. Lastly, future perspectives were also identified for specialists to design more effective and sustainable CWs. This information is used to inspire some novel intensifying methodologies, and benefit the successful applications of potential CW technologies.

The total net nutrient accumulation by CW plants was 104 g N/m(2) and 7.6 g P/m(2) for Pennisetum sinese Roxb, 144 g N/m(2) and 8.71 g P/m(2) for Pennisetum purpureum Schum. Three CW systems (System A planting with Pennisetum sinese Roxb, System B planting with Pennisetum purpureum Schum., and System C without planting) were designed to evaluate total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiency from wastewater. Results showed that the removal efficiency of TP from both System A and System B were significantly higher than that of System C, but there are no significant differences of the removal of TN among the three CW systems. After a five-month CW operation, System C was clogged and the TP removal efficiency was negative due to desorption of TP from the substrate. Our study demonstrated that the two newly selected plant species had a positive effect on removing TN and TP from wastewater and reducing clogging in the CW systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The experiments were carried out in a pilot plant (0.4 m(2)) treating urban wastewater with an organic loading rate of 40-60 g COD/m(2) d. Continuous and intermittent aeration was performed from the bottom on 8% of the wetland surface, leading to different dissolved oxygen concentrations within the wetlands (from 0.2 to 5 mg O-2/L). Continuous aeration increased organic matter (COD) and ammonium nitrogen removal by 56% and 69%, respectively. Improvements in wastewater treatment caused by aeration can result in reduction of the surface area requirement of future systems. This work demonstrated that for the studied configuration the cost of the power consumption of the continuous aeration was largely covered by the reduction of the wetlands surface. Even if the heating of 8% of the wetland surface at 21 degrees C had no effects on treatment performance, positive results showed that solids accumulation rate within the granular medium, which is closely related to the development of clogging. It has been demonstrated that heating for 10 days per year during 20 year period would delay the equivalent of 1 year of solids accumulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Wastewater treatment in a compact intensified wetland system at the Badboot: a floating swimming pool in Belgium	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL)	OCT 13-17, 2013	Nantes, FRANCE			Intensified wetland; Aerated wetland; Anammox; Vertical flow wetland; P-k-C*	DESIGN	The Badboot (Dutch for swimming pool boat) is a floating swimming pool located in the city center of Antwerp in Belgium. The overall design consists of a recycled ferry boat that serves as a restaurant and next to that a newly built ship that harbours an Olympic size swimming pool, sun decks, locker rooms with showers, and a party space. A major design goal of the project was to make the ship as environmentally friendly as possible. To avoid discharge of contaminated waste water in the Antwerp docks, the ship includes onsite treatment of wastewater in a compact constructed wetland. The treatment wetland system was designed to treat wastewater from visitor locker rooms, showers, toilets, two bars, and the wastewater from the restaurant kitchen. Due to the limited space on board the ship, only 188 m(2) could be allocated to a wetland treatment system. As a result, part of the design included intensification of the wetland treatment process through the use of Forced Bed Aeration, which injects small quantities of air in a very uniform grid pattern throughout the wetland with a mechanical air compressor. The system was monitored between August 2012 and March 2013 (with additional sampling in the autumn of 2014). Flows and loads to the wetland were highly variable, but removal efficiency was extremely high; 99.5 % for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 88.6 % for total nitrogen and 97.2 % for ammonia. The treatment performance was assessed using a first-order, tanks-in-series model (the P-k-C* model) and found to be roughly equivalent to similar intensified wetlands operating in Germany. However, treatment performance was substantially better than data reported on passive wetlands, likely as a result of intensification. Even with mechanically assisted aeration, the total oxygen delivered to the treatment wetlands was insufficient to support conventional nitrification and denitrification, so it is likely that alternate nitrogen removal pathways, such as anammox, are operating in the wetland.

Evaluation of the performance and space requirement by three different hybrid constructed wetlands in a stack arrangement	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constructed wetland; Footprint; Nutrients; Organic matter	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; POLLUTED RIVER WATER; NITROGEN REMOVAL; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; ORGANIC-MATTER; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SOLIDS ACCUMULATION; CLOGGING PROCESSES; POROUS-MEDIA; FLOW	Lack of space for a wastewater treatment plant is a common problem in many areas, especially in dense cities. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are efficient natural systems; however, they require large areas. The aim of this study is the development of a compact CW design for the treatment of domestic wastewater, the Duplex-CW: a hybrid system with a stacked design (vertical flow CW (VFCW) on top of a horizontal flow filter (HFF)). The performance of three different configurations of Duplex-CW, called fill and drain, stagnant batch and free drain, was compared. The VFCWs operated differently with the intention of creating different oxygen conditions, whereas the HFFs were operated identically. The Duplex-CWs were subjected to three different wastewater strengths, corresponding to designs of 7.9, 3.4 and 2.6 m(2) PE-1. The highest strength was treated with and without artificial aeration of the VFCW of each configuration. The contribution to the total removal of each compartment (VFCW and HFF), the effects of the use of artificial aeration, the solids accumulation, above-and below-ground biomass and the footprint requirements of the three configurations tested were determined. The fill and drain configuration performed better than the other two, the VFCW compartment being more active in the treatment than the HFF. It achieved an area of 2.6-3.4 m(2) PE-1 and it needed 2-3 times lower area than what a single VFCW would have needed to reach similar total nitrogen effluent concentrations. The Duplex- CW did not contribute to the footprint reduction, for other parameters (e.g. COD, TSS and total phosphorus). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The relationship between the accumulated solid material and infiltration rate, the content and particle size distribution as well as the ratio of organic and inorganic matter of the accumulated material in the filter media were determined, and the mechanisms of clogging were elucidated. The clogging mainly occurred in the upper 0-40 cm layer, and the accumulated material decreased with filter depth (along the flow direction). The main particle size contributing to clogging was similar to 40 mu m in the WSVFCWs for secondary treatment and >110 mu m in those for tertiary treatment. The accumulated material had 30-40% of organic matter. The clogging mechanisms varied as the composition of influent and aeration conditions are different in WSVFCWs. Aeration promoted the growth of biofilm and mineralization of the accumulated material as well as provided shear force in the WSVFCWs. Aeration has a good effect in extending operational time in the tertiary WSVFCW but has a mild effect in the secondary WSVFCWs because of high organic loading rate there. Both the organic and suspended solids (SS) loading rate are important factors and should be controlled to mitigate the clogging problem in WSVFCWs. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Matrix oxidation reduction potential (ORP) results showed that intermittent aeration well developed aerobic conditions in upper matrix and anoxic or anaerobic conditions in the subsequent sections, which resulted in high NH4+-N and TN removal. Moreover, intermittent aeration increased removal rates of COD and TP. Microbial populations and enzyme activities analysis proved that intermittent aeration not only obviously boosted the growth and reproduction of bacteria, fungus, actinomyces, nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria, but also successfully increased nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NIR) in the depth of 80 and 110 cm. The results suggest that the intermittent aeration could be a widespread research and application strategy for achieving the high removal performance in SWISs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of operating factors on the performance of MSL is insufficiently understood, and this limits its further application to some extent. The present paper provides a holistic overview of the crucial operating parameters, including clogging and HLR, aeration, media composition and structure, temperature, and C/N ratio. In particular, clogging and HLR are discussed extensively, since they could cause much greater deterioration over the lifetime of the soil filter than the other factors. There are currently few relevant reports regarding the balance between maintaining the reasonable range of HLR and minimizing less chance of clogging. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes two applicable ways to reduce the opportunity for clogging, namely, system suspension and/or enhanced aeration, which will be time-saving and low cost. In addition, to increase the denitrification capacity of MSL, effluent recirculation is proposed, a novel recommendation based on the municipal wastewater treatment processes, which could also improve the controllability of MSL from the perspective of biochemical reaction.

The TFCW achieved high and stable COD (77-94%), NH4+-N (55-82%), and TN (60-84%) removal efficiencies simultaneously, without costly aeration. Quantitative response relationships between nitrogen transformation rates and nitrogen functional genes were established, and these relationships confirmed that, under the FT constraints, the anammox 16S rRNA was the key factor of the NH4+-N transformation rates, whereas, (napA + narG) was the key factor regulating the NO3--N transformation rate. The analysis also revealed that the simultaneous nitrification, anammox, and denitrification (SNAD) process was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway in the TFCW. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During winter operations, weather-related de-icing activity results in large shifts in the flow and concentrations of airport run-off. The biological treatment of spent de-icing fluids is challenging because it involves the treatment of a cold and nutrient-deficient wastewater of variable flow and strength. After a successful full scale trial to determine the efficacy of aerated wetlands, the entire treatment system was upgraded and optimized in 2010. It consisted of a primary reservoir, partial and complete mix zones, a balancing lagoon, and 12 aerated horizontal sub-surface flow (HSSF) treatment wetlands operating in parallel, with a total wetland area of 2.08 ha. The original non-aerated HSSF wetland system, commissioned in 2001 had a design cBOD(5) loading rate of 374 kg/day at a flow rate of 40 l/s (Revitt et al., 2001; Richter et al., 2003). The aerated HSSF wetlands now have a design cBOD(5) loading rate of 2073 kg/day at a maximum flow rate of 80 l/s. Due to the weather conditions of the UK, the system is event-driven with highly variable flows and loads, with peak cBOD(5) loadings of up to 12,188 kg/day. The entire treatment system is now designed to remove 3500 kg/day cBOD(5) at a design flow of 40 l/s. It has a combined capacity of >44,000 m(3) of wastewater with a retention time of approximately 21 days, depending on the pump flow rate which varies between 40 and 80 l/s. Nutrient dosing points have been positioned at strategic points throughout the whole system to prevent nutrient deficiency becoming a limiting factor in the development of a stable and viable mass of bacteria necessary to achieve the design criteria.

In this study we explored the spatial dynamics of microbial community metabolic function in several different constructed treatment wetland designs at the pilot-scale constructed wetlands of the UFZ Ecotechnology Research Facility in Langenreichenbach, Germany. The constructed wetland designs differed in terms of flow direction, degree of saturation, depth, and intensification. Internal sampling was conducted in April 2013 at different locations along the flow path of each system. The microbial community metabolic function was characterized via community level physiological profiling (CLPP). Microbial community activity (substrate utilization rate) and metabolic richness (number of carbon sources utilize) decreased dramatically with increasing distance along the flow path for most systems. Variation in the metabolic function of microbial communities was observed based on carbon source utilization patterns (CSUPs) and was found to be strongly influenced by system design and sample location within the wetland but not by the presence of plants or depth of media. Analysis of specific carbon source guilds highlighted increased utilization of polymers and carbohydrates in the early stages of all systems, pointing to the establishment of microbial communities optimized to best utilize more easily degradable compounds close to the inlet. Correlations between measures of microbial functionality (activity, richness, and diversity) and turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) were observed in horizontal-flow systems but less so in vertical-flow systems. The results presented provide useful insight into the spatial dynamics of microbial community function in constructed wetlands. Potential opportunities for system optimization, based on the results of this study, are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using aerated gravel-packed contact bed and constructed wetland system for polluted river water purification: A case study in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Aerated gravel-packed contact bed; Constructed wetland; River pollution; Water quality; Wetland hydrology	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; ELECTROPLATING WASTE-WATER; HYDRAULIC LOADING RATES; PILOT-SCALE; NITROGEN REMOVAL; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; DIVERSITY; RETENTION	The Ju-Liao Stream is one of the most contaminated streams in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. A constructed wetland (CW) system was built in 2010 for polluted stream water purification and ecosystem improvement. An aerated gravel-packed contact bed (CB) system was built in 2011 and part of the stream water was treated by the CB before discharging to the CW. The influent rates of the CW and CB were approximately 5570 and 900 m(3)/d, respectively. The CW contained one free-water surface basin planted with emergent wetland plants, followed by the plug-flow channel-shaped free-water surface basin planted with emergent and floating wetland plants. The mean measured hydraulic loading rate (HLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT), water depth, and total volume of wetland system were 1.7 m/d, 0.68 d, 0.7 m, and 4400 m(3), respectively. The aeration zone of the CB system had a dimension of 24 m (L) x 8 m (W) x 3 m (H), which was filled with gravels (average diameter = 5 cm) with a porosity of 0.4, and the aeration rate was 7.8 m(3)/min. Results show that the CB system was able to remove 69% of suspended solid (SS), 86% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and 58% of total nitrogen (TN). Up to 82% of BOD and 27% of TN could be removed in the CW system. Removal efficiency of SS was affected by the growth of chlorophyll a in the CW system due to the growth of algae. The observed first-order decay rates (k) for BOD and TN in CB were 9.3 and 4.2 1/d, and the k values for BOD and TN removal in CW were 2.5 and 0.45 1/d. The high pollutant removal efficiencies in the CB system indicate that the system could enhance the organic and nutrient removal through the biological processes effectively. Sediments contained high total organic matter (1.9-4.5%), sediment total nitrogen (6.4-10.1 g/kg), sediment total phosphorus (0.59-0.94 g/kg), and sediment oxygen demand (0.9-4.1 g O-2/m(2) d). The organic and nutrient-abundant sediments resulted in reduced conditions (oxidation-reduction potential measurements <158 my). Increased evenness, richness, and biodiversity for birds and amphibious animals reveal that the CW had a positive impact on the ecosystem conservation and wildlife habitat rehabilitation.

This review is accordingly necessary to better understand this state-of-the-art technology for further design development and new ideas. Full-scale cases of CWs for treating various industrial effluents are summarized, and challenges including high organic loading, salinity, extreme pH, and low biodegradability and color are evaluated. Even horizontal flow CWs are widely used because of their passive operation, tolerance to high organic loading, and decolorization capacity, free water surface flow CWs are effective for treating oil field/refinery and milking parlor/cheese making wastewater for settlement of total suspended solids, oil, and grease. Proper pretreatment, inflow dilutions through re-circulated effluent, pH adjustment, plant selection and intensifications in the wetland bed, such as aeration and bioaugmentation, are recommended according to the specific characteristics of industrial effluents.

The electrodes material employed in the study was carbon felt. The main aim of this study is to assess the performance of the UFCW coupling with MFC in term of ability to treat wastewater and the capability to generate bioelectricity. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) profile showed that the anaerobic and aerobic regions were well developed in the lower and upper bed, respectively, of UFCW-MFC. Biodegradation of organic matter, nitrification and denitrification was investigated and the removal efficiencies of COD, NO3, NH4+ were 100%, 40%, and 91%, respectively. The maximum power density of 6.12 mWm(-2) and coulombic efficiency of 8.6% were achieved at electrode spacing of anode 1 (A1) and cathode (15 cm). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the aboveground biomass is usually harvested before winter to maintain the permanent removal of nutrients. In this work, the effects of harvest on plants' involvement in oxygen input as well as in microbial abundance and activity were investigated in detail. Three series of constructed wetlands with integrated plants ("unharvested"), harvested plants ("harvested"), and fully cleared plants ("cleared") were set up. Better performance was found in the unharvested units, with the radial oxygen loss (ROL) rates ranging from 0.05 to 0.59 mu mol O-2/h/plant, followed by the harvested units that had relatively lower ROL rates (0.01 to 0.52 mu mol O-2/h/plant). The cleared units had the lowest removal efficiency, which had no rhizome resources from the plants. The microbial population and activity were highest in the unharvested units, followed by the harvested and cleared units. Results showed that bacterial abundances and enhanced microbial activity were ten times higher on root surfaces compared with sands. These results indicate that late autumn harvesting of the aboveground biomass exhibited negative effects on plant ROL as well as on the microbial population and activity during the following winter.

Therefore, this research aims to improve the design of treating ammonia using constructed wetlands by targeting biogeochemical conditions needed for nitrification and denitrification. A pilot-scale constructed wetland was designed and constructed to meet targeted ranges of dissolved oxygen concentration, hydrosoil redox potential, pH, alkalinity, and organic carbon availability to enhance nitrification and denitrification. Design features included aeration, sucrose, and oyster shell addition. The constructed wetland decreased ammonia-N from similar to 20 mg/L in inflow to nondetectable levels (<0.1 mg/L) in outflow during three of the four treatment months. Measured biogeochemical conditions indicate that nitrification continued to occur while hydrosoil redox potential, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH were lower than the targeted ranges. Conversely, denitrification continued to occur while pH was lower than the targeted range, and dissolved oxygen concentration was higher than the targeted range. The success of the constructed wetland in removing ammonia and nitrate under conditions outside of target ranges was attributed to the existence of heterogeneous macro- and microenvironments within individual wetland cells that allow both reactions to occur simultaneously under a wider range of conditions than previously expected. Results from this study demonstrated the advantage of designing constructed wetlands to promote biogeochemical conditions for improved ammonia treatment and also provide the basis for treatment of ammonia-contaminated produced waters.

The reactor had an intermittent aeration system; hydraulic retention time (HRT) of one day; temperature of 30 degrees C; and recirculation ratio of five times the flow. An experimental central composite rotational delineation (CCRD) type design was used to define the aeration conditions and nitrogen load (factors) to be studied. Response surface methodology was used to analyse the influence of the factors above the results, the removal of TN and COD. It was observed that the aeration factor showed the greatest significance for the results and that the affluent TKN concentration did not have a significant effect, at a 95% level of confidence, on COD removal. Throughout the experiment, the COD/N ratio remained between 3.2 and 3.8. The best results for COD and TN removal, 80% and 88%, respectively, were obtained with 158 min of aeration on a cycle of 180 min and 255 mg L-1 of Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) in the substrate.

For the purpose of understanding the characteristics of direct CO2 emissions during biological nutrient removal from urban WWTPs, we investigated four different processes. Full-scale tests were carried out continuously during a two-year period, consisting of the anoxic/anaerobic/oxic (A(2)O) process, the anoxic/oxic (AO) process, the oxidation ditch, and the sequencing batch reactor (SBR) processes. Our experimental results show large differences in CO2 fluxes in the various treatment tanks (or periods), e.g. the aerated units/periods in four different WWTPs all contributed more than 96.0% of the entire direct CO2 emission caused by aerobic respiration and aeration stripping. On the other hand, CO2 emissions from non-aerated areas were quite low giving rise to small amounts of CO2 emissions during anaerobic metabolism. The direct emission of CO2 when treating per m(3) wastewater (g CO2/m(3) wastewater) corresponded with the following descending order among the four processes: SBR (347.34) > oxidation ditch (343.78) > A(2)O (175.68) > AO (173.37). However, this order changed into SBR (0.97) > oxidation ditch (0.76) > AO (0.68) > A(2)O (0.58) when treating per kilogram COD (kg CO2/kg COD).

In this study, influent and effluent were sampled monthly for the analyses of dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen and nitrate. Results showed that removal rates of BOD, SS and NH3-N ranged 85-95% (averaged 90%), 70-95% (averaged 85%), and 70-90% (averaged 80%), respectively. Therefore, the gravel contact oxidation system is quite effective in pollution control for combined sewage and rainwater. However, microbial denitrification was not effective due to high concentrations of dissolved oxygen in non-aeration zones of the gravel contact oxidation treatment system. Although the concentration of NH3-N decreased quickly, nitrogen was not removed by microbial degradation. It was only a migration process among different forms of nitrogen. Therefore, it is important to effectively control aeration in the front zone of the gravel contact oxidation treatment system to improve the removal efficiency of total nitrogen.

There are three horizontal flow tanks in this system, horizontal flow and aerated oyster shell tank (HAOS), horizontal flow oyster shell tank (HOS), and horizontal flow gravel tank (HG), respectively. In the results of the horizontal flow and aerated oyster shell tank (HAOS), the average mass removal of BOD5, SS, NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, and TP were 18.78, 58.95, 11.74, -1.19, 0.50, and 0.87 g/m(2) day. The BOD5 first-order reaction reducing rate constant in 20 degrees C was 2.20/day. Consequently, using oyster shells as the material of the subsurface flow, constructed wetland had better water purification efficiency than using gravels. In this system, part of the BOD5 was removed because of the removal of SS, and there was better blocking effect when using oyster shells as the materials than gravels. Aeration can effectively remove ammonia nitrogen, but the main purpose was to strengthen the nitrification in the water, so that ammonia nitrogen was converted into nitrate nitrogen. Oyster shells as the material still had better removal effect of nitrogen than gravels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NOV.; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; REMOVAL EFFICIENCY; VERTICAL FLOW	Horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) with and without redox manipulation by front aeration were operated to treat mechanically pretreated wastewater from a nearby wastewater treatment plant. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 454-pyrosequencing were used to characterize the shifts in bacterial community diversity and composition in response to front aeration in the HSSF CWs. Both techniques revealed similar bacterial diversity between the HSSF CWs with (ACW) and without front aeration (NACW). Differences in microbial functional groups between the ACW and the NACW substrate samples were identified with 454-pyrosequencing. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrospira) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (Nitrosomonas) had much higher abundances in the ACW, whereas more sequences related to sulfate-reducing bacteria and anaerobic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (genera Sulfuricella, Sulfuritalea, and Sulfuricurvum) were detected in the NACW. Removal efficiencies for NH4+-N, PO43--P and chemical oxygen demand in the ACW were 48.7 +/- 15.5, 70.2 +/- 13.5, and 82.0 +/- 6.4 %, respectively, whereas the removal efficiencies for these parameters in the NACW were 10.3 +/- 14.0, 53.1 +/- 18.9, and 68.8 +/- 10.7%, respectively. In the ACW, the stimulation of nitrification via front aeration supplied more NO2--N and NO3--N to the subsequent denitrification process than in the NACW, resulting in higher total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency. The differences in treatment efficiencies between the ACW and the NACW could be partially explained by the different bacterial community compositions in the two CWs.

In this study, a combination of four stage CWs (three horizontal subsurface flows followed by one free water surface flow) was configured to treat low-strength aquaculture wastewater. For performance assessment, the wetlands were monitored over three years, during which artificial aeration was added to them. By the results, the organic matters and nutrients were mainly sequestered in the anterior subsurface flows, while the surface flow mainly contributed to DO improvement. These results probably implied no necessity of excessive subsurface flows connected in a staged manner. In addition, the artificial aeration improved the treatment performance on ammonium-N, TN and TP in the first-stage CW.

The results of the lab-scale experiments showed that water quality parameters improved remarkably after treatment by the combined method. With the retention time of 8 d, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) were observed to be reduced, with the mean removal efficiency of 53.4%, 85.0%, 24.9% and 37.0%. Accordingly, the mean Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) increased from 130.0 to 182.8 mV, the mean pH decreased from 10.0 to 8.0, and the mean transparency improved from 20 to 90 cm. It was proved that the improvement of polluted water was mainly resulted from the synergistic reaction of the biofilm and aeration. The combined process had the better performance in field-scale experiment. Water quality in the treated area arrived at Degree VI of the State Standard for Surface Water. The results indicate that usefulness of the combined process to remediate polluted landscape water.

However, seasonal variations and aeration effects on phytoremediation performance and root-adhered microbial communities are still unclear. In this study, Pontederia cordata was used to treat polluted urban river water under various aeration intensities. Results showed that the highest removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) and total nitrogen (TN) were attained under aeration of 30 L min(-1) in spring and summer and 15 L min(-1) in autumn, while total phosphorus (TP) removal reached maximum with aeration of 15 L min(-1) in all seasons. Moderate aeration was beneficial for increasing the diversity of root-adhered bacteria communities, and the shift of bacterial community structure was more pronounced in spring and autumn with varying aeration intensity. The dual effect, i.e. turbulence and dissolved oxygen (DO), of aeration on the removal of CODCr and TN prevailed over the individual effect of DO, while DO was the most influential factor for TP removal and the root-adhered bacterial community diversity. P. cordata combined with 15 L min(-1) aeration was deemed to be the best condition tested in this study.

The structure of granular sludge is influenced by EPS production. The average diameter and density of biogranules increase due to EPS production. Although polysaccharides are essential, proteins were found to be the predominant component of aerobic granular sludge. Compared to loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS), tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) showed more significant correlations with granules formation. This investigation will contribute towards a better understanding of the behavior and composition of EPS in sequencing batch reactors. The traditional nitrification and denitrification processes proceed well with typical municipal wastewater. Nevertheless, there are also nitrogen-rich wastewater streams like landfill leachate or reject waters from dewatering of digested sludge, for which traditional nitrification/denitrification can be generally ineffective due to free ammonia inhibition of nitrification and unfavorable biodegradable carbon content for denitrification. Because of high requirements for oxygen and the necessity for addition of external carbon source, treating such nitrogen-rich streams with nitrification/denitrification would become expensive and unsustainable. The least resources consuming pathway for the conversion of ammonium to nitrogen gas is a combination of partial nitrification and the Anammox process. The main advantages of this process compared to the conventional nitrification/denitrification are: low sludge production, decrease of the aeration costs by almost 60% (only half of the ammonia is oxidized to nitrite in the nitritation process without farther oxidation to nitrate), and no need for external organic carbon source addition (Anammox process). Furthermore, anammox bacteria oxidize ammonium under anoxic conditions with nitrite as the electron acceptor, and converse energy for CO2 fixation. Additionally, the biomass yield of the Anammox process is very low (0.08 kg VSS kg NH4-N-1 in comparison to 1 kg VSS kg NH4-N-1 in conventional nitrification/denitrification process) consequently, little sludge is produced. The low sludge production is another factor that contributes to the substantially lower operation costs compared to conventional denitrification systems. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are oxidative methods which are based on the generation of the hydroxyl radicals, which are very reactive and less selective than other oxidants. In the wastewater treatment technology, AOPs can be used in a combination with conventional biological techniques (so called hybrid processes), as pre- and post- treatment processes. The advanced oxidation processes have been used in order to increase the biodegradability and also detoxification of the wastewater. The ability of fungi to degrade lignin-cellulose debris is well known. In addition to these natural molecules they may also degrade synthetic compounds, including synthetic dyes. High effectiveness of Evans blue and brilliant green mixture removal by all tested strains was demonstrated. The process was the most effective and fast in shaken conditions. Finally strain MB removed 90% of tested mixture in shaken samples after 96h. It was the best result reached among all the strains used in the experiment. High removal efficiency was accompanied by a decrease of toxicity (from V class to III class in test with D. magna and from IV class even to non-toxic in test with L. minor). The highest decrease of phytotoxicity was noticed in samples with shaken biomass in which the effect of dyes mixture elimination was the beg. The research indicates very high potential of tested strains for decolorization and detoxification of dyes mixture. Constructed wetlands are man-made system mimicking the process occurring in natural wetlands. These systems are considered to be an alternative to more technically advanced waste water treatment technologies. The development of constructed wetlands is envisaged to pursue the following directions grouped according to: the type of the waste water to be treated, target contaminants, treatment intensification methods, ancillary benefits and the locality. Mycorrhiza fungi can be used for phytoremediation proccess. They support plant growth by lowering the stress caused by the lack of phosphorus and water. They produce enzymes participating in several stages of xenobiotics decomposition, which is helpful in their further biodegradation performed by the other rhisospherical organisms. The natural colonisation of PAHs contaminated soil is a long-term process. It could be shortend by adding fungal propagules as an inoculum to the soil. Fungi used for the injections should be isolated from PAHs contaminated soil. That guarantees their survival and development in the contaminated environment. The level of PAHs elimination from soil depends on a type of bioremediation modification used. It was shown that the best results are obtained with monocotylous plants combined with bacterial and fungal biopreparations obtained from contaminated soil. The symbiosis of mycorrhiza fungi with monocotylous plants caused ca. 40% increase of 3, 4, 5 and 30% of 6-ring hydrocarbons removal from soil in comparison with the conventional methods. Important aspect of environmental protection and engineering is the possibility for qualitative and quantitative monitoring of complex microbial communities, responsible for biotechnological processes, such as: soil bioremediation, wastewater treatment or composting. Due to the fact that most of the environmental bacteria cannot be grown in the laboratory conditions molecular techniques are widely used in environmental engineering. Among these methods the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based and hybridization-based (such as Fluorescent in situ Hybridization; FISH) techniques are known to be the most useful.

CW technology is well known worldwide to treat municipal wastewater, rainwater and also industrial wastewater. The problem with reject water is mainly concerning high concentration of ammonia nitrogen. It is observed mainly in municipal WWTPs utilizing anaerobic sewage sludge stabilization. Dairy WWTP belonging to Mlekovita was modernized in 2013 with implementation of flotation process in wastewater line and anaerobic stabilization of excess and flotation sludge. Probably this is the biggest dairy WWTP in Poland. It is operating (July 2014) with 6886 m3/d and personal equivalent about 278 000 (project was done for PE 35 0000 and maximum flow 75000 m(3)/d). Reject water as a byproduct like sewage sludge is returned to the beginning of wastewater line. During own research with reject water it was found that concentration of ammonia nitrogen was varied from 291 N-NH4+/dm(3)to 423 mg N-NH4+/dm(3). while value of BOD5 from 132 to 185 mg O-2/dm(3). Laboratory scale investigation was carried out with vertical flow CW model with total depth 0,65 m. filled with gravel and sand. Two hydraulic loads were applied during investigations -0,1 and 0,2 m/d. The temperature during two series was changing from 22,0 do 26,0 degrees C. High efficiency of BOD5 removal (up to 91%) from reject water produced in dairy WWTP was observed. The efficiency of ammonia nitrogen removal was varied from 78,3% to 90,0%. The efficiency of total phosphorus removal was low in both series. Vertical flow constructed wetland can be used as a low cost method to decrease load of dairy WWTP utilizing anaerobic sewage sludge utilization. To increase efficiency of reject water treatment lower hydraulic load (from 0,05 m/d) should be applied. Future researches will be carried out with real scale installation in Wysokie Mazowieckie equipped with special aeration system to supply vertical flow CW with oxygen.

The individual and combined effects of micro-aeration and substrate selection on the purification performance of the experimental-scale HSSF CWs were evaluated. The results showed that micro-aeration significantly increased the treatment efficiencies for chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (PO43--P) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) using HSSF CWs, while the substrate selection significantly affected the TP, PO43--P and NH4+-N removal efficiencies (p < 0.05). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that there was a significant interaction term (i.e. micro-aeration x substrate selection) for NH4+-N removal (p < 0.05). Among the three substrates, ceramsite was the best substrate for the treatment of domestic sewage using HSSF CWs. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that a ceramsite-filled HSSF CW with micro-aeration could be the optimal configuration for decentralized domestic sewage treatment.

The results showed that aeration increased Eh of all sites, and enlarged the depth of aerobic zone from 33cm to 69cm in the summer and from 17cm to 54cm in the winter. Artificial aeration significantly enhanced dehydrogenase and urease activities, while phosphatase activity was not improved. Four kinds of saturated phospholipid fatty acid (PLFAs) were not determined in aerated IVCW, while artificial aeration obviously increased the relative contents of monounsaturated PLFAs, suggesting that the proportion of aerobic microorganisms significantly increased. More importantly, intermittent aeration had little effect on the relative contents of cyclopropane PLFAs at the bottom layer, indicating that anaerobic denitrification and the proportion of anaerobic microorganisms were not affected. These results could demonstrate why the aerated IVCW had a better treatment performance.

This paper reports on an experiment conducted to assess the performance of a floating helophytes filter (FHF) to remove total nitrogen (TN) and the effect of supplemental aeration on nitrification and denitrification. The supply of external eration to the FHF system reduced significantly (p<0.05) the TN final concentration in spring, summer, and autumn experiments, whereas in the winter experiment a strong N-NO3-; accumulation was recorded in the FHF-aerated treatment that resulted in a poorer TN removal percentage (p>0.05). Low organic matter concentration is the most likely cause of the denitrification slowdown in the winter experiment.

Partial nitritation ANAMMOX in submerged attached growth bioreactors with smart aeration at 20 degrees C	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITROGEN-REMOVAL; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; BACTERIA; ORGANICS; REACTOR	Submerged attached growth bioreactors (SAGBs) were operated at 20 degrees C for 30 weeks in smart-aerated, partial nitritation ANAMMOX mode and in a timer-controlled, cyclic aeration mode. The smart-aerated SAGBs removed 48-53% of total nitrogen (TN) compared to 45% for SAGBs with timed aeration. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations and cyclic pH patterns in the smart-aerated SAGBs suggested conditions favorable to partial nitritation ANAMMOX and stoichiometrically-derived and numerically modeled estimations attributed 63-68% and 14-44% of TN removal to partial nitritation ANAMMOX in these bioreactors, respectively. Ammonia removals of 36-67% in the smart-aerated SAGBs, with measured oxygen and organic carbon limitations, further suggest partial nitritation ANAMMOX. The smart-aerated SAGBs required substantially less aeration to achieve TN removals similar to SAGBs with timer-controlled aeration. Genomic DNA testing confirmed that the dominant ANAMMOX seed bacteria, received from a treatment plant utilizing the DEMON (R) sidestream deammonification process, was a Candidatus Brocadia sp. (of the Planctomycetales order). The DNA from these bacteria was also present in the SAGBs at the conclusion of the study providing evidence for attached growth and limited biomass washout.

The intermittent aeration strategy not only significantly increased removal efficiencies of organic pollutants and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), but also successfully created alternate aerobic and anaerobic conditions resulting in high total nitrogen (TN) removal. Moreover, increasing influent strength did not affect the removal efficiencies of organic matters and nitrogen in aerated VFCWs. Compared with non-aerated VFCWs, much higher removal of organic pollutants (96%), NH4+-N (98%), and TN (85%) was obtained simultaneously in intermittent aeration VFCWs, especially at high influent strengths. The results suggest that the intermittent aeration could be an appropriate strategy for achieving the high removal performance in VFCWs, especially for in-situ treatment of high strength decentralized domestic wastewaters.

J	Kimwaga, RJ				Kimwaga, R. J.			Modeling of Dissolved Oxygen Transfer Capacity of Constructed Wetlands Treating Domestic Wastewater	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS & STATISTICS			English	Article						Dissolved Oxygen; Rate; Oxygen Transfer; Convection; Diffusion; HSSFCW		Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is one of the principal control parameters in the performance of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSFCW). DO is important parameter since most important degradation processes (carbon degradation, nitrification) require aerobic conditions and thus sufficient oxygen supply is of high importance. Effective supply of air significantly improves the treatment performance of HSSFCW especially Nitrogen removal. Various aeration strategies can be tested by means of modeling and computer simulation. In this study, a model of dissolved oxygen transfer was developed to predict the rates of oxygen transfer capacity in the HSSFCW over a wide range of inlet conditions (flow rates, BOD5, COD, NH3 and NO3). The predicted oxygen transfer rates are based on performance of BOD5, COD, NH3 and NH3, in which the latter is the most difficult parameter to remove in HSSFCW. The study was carried out in the HSSFCW located at the outlet/downstream of Maturation Waste Stabilizations Ponds (MWSP) located at the University of Dar es Salaam main campus, Tanzania. The HSSFCW measuring 3m (width), 9m (length) and 0.6m (depth) was planted with Phragmite Mauritiunus and packed with 8mm - 32mm diameter limestone gravel. The simulation results were compared with data originating from the field. The model that best reflected the temporal distributions of the DO concentrations of the HSSFCW was the one-dimensional diffusion-convection equation with a variable overall oxygen transfer coefficient in the source term for dissolved oxygen. The model results from this study shows that the oxygen concentration from diffusion is 27 gO(2)m(-2)day(-1) while convection is about 5.7 gO(2)m(-2)day(-1). The measured and predicted DO concentrations are closely correlated as they gave R-2 values of 0.87 suggesting that a model can be used for predicting dissolved oxygen transfer capacity in HSSFCW.

The results clearly indicated that the pre-dam reservoir under study significantly improved the quality of the water flowing through the pre-dam. The greatest reduction in the pollutant concentration, particularly for suspended solids, NH4-N, and chlorpyrifos was observed in the settling area of the pre-dam reservoir. The results of this study indicate that pre-dams may be successfully applied to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution in the Taihu Lake basin. However, the pre-dam reservoir was not able to completely eliminate all the contaminants flowing into Taihu Lake.	[Bian, B.; Wu, H.

The greater removals of BOD5, COD, total phosphorus and NH4-N were observed in floating microcosms planted with Alternanthera philoxeroides or Cyperus alternifolius, respectively. The microcosms planted with Scirpus validus exhibited the greatest removals of total nitrogen, and those planted with Canna generalis showed a great removal of NO3-N. The above-ground biomass was positively related to the removal of the NO3-N, while the translocation factor for nitrogen was positively related to total nitrogen and phosphorus, the translocation factor for phosphorus was positively related to the removals of total phosphorus and NO3-N, respectively. Nevertheless, bacterial community parameters such as the ribotype number and diversity index were not correlated with the removals of pollutants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Heterogeneous redox conditions (with a high-low-high tendency in the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) values) along the water flow direction were observed in the aerated CW (ACW). In contrast, the CW without aeration (NACW) was dominated by anoxic or anaerobic conditions. Good nitrogen and phosphate removal efficiencies were obtained with the ACW configuration, which outperformed the NACW configuration. 2D contour plots are convenient for providing an improved understanding of the removal processes in HSSF CWs, which will be helpful for the optimization of CWs.

Effects of plant roots on the hydraulic performance during the clogging process in mesocosm vertical flow constructed wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Clogging; Plant root; Salt tracers; Hydraulic performance; Vertical flow-constructed wetlands	ORGANIC-MATTER ACCUMULATION; SOLIDS ACCUMULATION; CONDUCTIVITY; SUBSTRATE; PATTERN; GRAVEL; MODEL; WASTEWATERS; AERATION; DYNAMICS	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of plant roots (Typha angustifolia roots) on the hydraulic performance during the clogging process from the perspective of time and space distributions in mesocosm vertical flow-constructed wetlands with coarse sand matrix. For this purpose, a pair of lab-scale experiments was conducted to compare planted and unplanted systems by measuring the effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the substrate within different operation periods. Furthermore, the flow pattern of the clogging process in the planted and unplanted wetland systems were evaluated by their hydraulic performance (e.g., mean residence time, short circuiting, volumetric efficiency, number of continuously stirred tank reactors, and hydraulic efficiency factor) in salt tracer experiments. The results showed that the flow conditions would change in different clogging stages, which indicated that plants played different roles related to time and space. In the early clogging stages, plant roots restricted the flow of water, while in the middle and later clogging stages, especially the later stage, growing roots opened new pore spaces in the substrate. The roots played an important role in affecting the hydraulic performance in the upper layer (0-30 cm) where the sand matrix had a larger root volume fraction. Finally, the causes of the controversy over plant roots' effects on clogging were discussed. The results helped further understand the effects of plant roots on hydraulic performance during the clogging process.	[Hua, G. F.; Guo, R.; Zeng, Y.

However, most previous studies have focused on environmental and/or economic dimensions ignoring social aspects. Moreover, they tend to be based on sets of indicators rather than providing a holistic assessment. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an innovative methodology to assess the sustainability of WWT systems based on the development of a composite indicator embracing economic, environmental and social issues. Subsequently, the global sustainability of seven WWT technologies for secondary treatment in small communities is compared. The joint application of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to assign weights to each indicator allows the incorporation of the preferences of experts. Initially, the global sustainability of the WWT technologies evaluated is quite similar. However, a scenario analysis illustrates that constructed wetlands technology is the most sustainable in five out of the seven scenarios evaluated. Moreover, extended aeration and rotating biological contactors are identified as the technologies with the lowest variability in their sustainability. Hence, in an uncertain context, they might be considered the preferred options. The proposed approach contributes to ease of interpretation of a complex problem such as the selection of the most sustainable WWT alternative. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

High and stable COD (83-95%), NH4+ - N (63-80%), and TN (50-82%) removal efficiency were simultaneously achieved in our single-stage TF CW without costly aeration. Results showed that a C/N ratio exceeding six was required to achieve complete denitrification without NO2- - N and NO3- - N accumulation in the system. Molecular biological analyses revealed aerobic ammonia oxidation was the dominant NH4+ - N removal pathway when the C/N ratio was less than or equal to six. However, when the C/N ratio was greater than six, anammox was notably enhanced, resulting in another primary NH4+ - N removal pathway, in addition to the aerobic ammonia oxidation. Quantitative response relationships between nitrogen transformation rates and nitrogen functional genes were established, and these relationships confirmed that different nitrogen transformation processes were coupled at the molecular level (functional genes), and collaboratively contributed to nitrogen removal in the TF CW. Specifically, NH4+ N transformation rates were collectively determined by amoA, nxrA, anammox, narG, nirS, nirK, and nosZ; and TN removal was influenced primarily by amoA and anammox.

Three of the systems were free-draining, with one containing a gravel substrate (VGp), while the other two contained sand substrate (VS1p and VS2p). The fourth system had a saturated gravel substrate and active aeration supplied across the bottom of the bed (VAp). All beds were pulse-loaded on an hourly basis, except VS2p, which was pulse-loaded every 2 h. Each system had a surface area of 62 m(2), received a hydraulic loading rate of 95 mm/day and was planted with Phragmites australis. The beds received an organic loading rate of 7-16 g TOC/m(2)d. The sand-based VF (VS1p) performed significantly better (p < 0.05) than the gravel-based wetland (VGp) both in the removal of conventional water quality parameters (TSS, TOC, NH4-N) and studied emerging organic contaminants except for diclofenac (85 +/- 17% vs. 74 +/- 15% average emerging organic contaminant removal for VS1p and VGp, respectively). Although loading frequency (hourly vs. bi-hourly) was not observed to affect the removal efficiency of the cited conventional water quality parameters, significantly lower removal efficiencies were found for tonalide and bisphenol A for the VF wetland that received bi-hourly dosing (VS2p) (higher volume per pulse), probably due to the more reducing conditions observed in that system. However, diclofenac was the only contaminant showing an opposite trend to the rest of the compounds, achieving higher elimination rates in the wetlands that exhibited less-oxidizing conditions (VS2p and VGp). The use of active aeration in the saturated gravel bed (VAp) generally improved the treatment performance compared to the free-draining gravel bed (VGp) and achieved a similar performance to the free-draining sand-based VF wetlands (VS1p).

High removal of 90.9% COD, 99.1% ammonium nitrogen and 88.1% total nitrogen (TN) were obtained simultaneously in HSFCW4 compared with HSFCW1-3. The excellent TN removal of HSFCW4 was due to artificial aeration provided sufficient DO for nitrification and the favorable anoxic environment created for denitrification. Step-feeding was a crucial factor because it provided sufficient carbon source (high COD: nitrate ratio of 14.3) for the denitrification process. Microbial activities and microbial abundance in HSFCW4 was found to be influenced by DO distribution and step-feeding, and thus improve TN removal. These results suggest that artificial aeration combined with step-feeding could achieve high nitrogen removal in HSFCWs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effect of hydraulic retention time (HRT) was also investigated in presence and absence of algal biofilm. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the independent factors governing the performance of CW. The study showed algal biofilm significantly improved nutrient removal, especially phosphate. Ammonia removal varied with HRT, biofilm and ambient temperature. Increase in biofilm thickness affected ammonia removal efficiency adversely. Algal biofilm-assisted COD removal compensated for reduced macrophyte density during winter. Two-way ANOVA test and the coefficients of dependent factors derived through multiple linear regression model confirmed role of algal biofilm in improving nutrient removal in CW. The study suggests that algal biofilm can be a green solution for bio-augmenting COD and nutrient removal in CW. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For two years, urban wastewater was treated in a full-scale wetland whose construction was based on conclusions drawn from laboratory tests. No clogging was observed. In contrast to existing designs, channel configuration is used for the plug-flow circulation of water, the bed has a longitudinal diagonal design of angular stones of decreasing size, and a circuit of forced natural ventilation is formed by the combination of wells and chimneys connected within an air chamber over the water surface. The cross-section values of influent load were four times higher than those traditionally employed. The stone diagonal splits the wetland into an upper region of aerated reactor and a lower region conveying water over a bed which works as an anaerobic digester, thereby demonstrating the importance of the circuit of aeration and of the gradient of hydraulic conductivity of the bed that adapts itself to the variation in the quality of the water along its course. Overloads and isolated halts fail to alter the oxidation-reduction potential since these biological systems present high inertia when faced with changes in feed supply. (C)2014 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental design of the work involved lab-scale and full-scale experiments to calibrate the multi-component reactive transport model for constructed wetlands (CW2D). Besides measured values for the hydraulic parameters and the maximum autotrophic growth rate, we calibrated two other parameters (oxygen re-aeration rate and adsorption coefficients of ammonium) to reduce the difference between predictions and measurements. The obtained model determined the time-variation of nitrogen concentrations in the effluent with reasonable performances. With the use of the model we demonstrate that, during feeding period, the ammonium was significantly adsorbed onto organic matter besides conversion into nitrates; the adsorbed mass of ammonium was nitrified during the rest period provoking high nitrates concentrations during the first two subsequent batches. We also demonstrated that heterotrophic biomass was mainly present in the sludge layer (first 20 cm), whereas autotrophic biomass was located in the first 50 cm of the VFCW (sludge and 30 cm biomat).

Effect of aeration on pollutants removal, biofilm activity and protozoan abundance in conventional and hybrid horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						protozoa; organic matter; horizontal flow constructed wetlands; aeration; biofilm	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; NITROGEN; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; BACTERIA; DESIGN; SYSTEM; PLANT	The large area demand of constructed wetlands (CWs) is documented as a weak point that can be potentially reduced by applying active aeration. The aim of this study was, therefore, to understand the effects of aeration on the treatment performance, the biofilm activity, the protozoan population size and potential CW footprint reduction of different horizontal flow (HF) CW configurations. Two experimental periods were considered: a first period with low organic loading rate (OLR) and a second period with high OLR. Three HF CW configurations were compared: a conventional (control), an aerated and a hybrid CW (aerated followed by a non-aerated CW). The results obtained reinforced the competence of aerated CW for organic matter removal (81-89% of chemical oxygen demand) while for nitrogen elimination the control (19-24%) and hybrid (8-41%) systems performed better than the aerated system (-6% to 33%). Biofilm activity and protozoa abundance were distinctly higher at the inlet zones when compared with the outlet zones of all CWs, as well as in the aerated systems when compared with the non-aerated CWs. The protozoan abundance increased with an increase in the OLR and ciliates were found to be the dominant group. Overall, the active aeration highlighted the efficiency and stability of the CWs for organic matter removal and thus can be used as a promising tool to enhance microbial activity and grazing by protozoa; eventually reducing solid accumulation in the bed media. These beneficial effects contribute to reduce the CWs' area requirements.	[Zapater-Pereyra, M.; Gashugi, E.; Rousseau, D. P. L.; Alam, M. R.; Bayansan, T.; Lens, P. N.

Good organic matter removal performance up to 90% was achieved for all experimental TFCWs under inflow concentrations of 300 and 150 mg/L regardless of F/D and effluent flow rate. The ammonium removal efficiency of wetland with F/D = 3 h:3 h (55%) was higher than that of the wetland with F/D = 5 h:1 h (47%) under an ammonium inflow concentration of 60 mg/L, indicating the positive effect of longer drained and shorter flooded time on tidal-operated wetlands under nitrification. In addition, more uniform oxygen distribution and better nitrification capacity within the wetland might be achieved with a relatively slow effluent flow rate of 0.025 L/s. TFCWs were shown to be a robust and reliable option to achieve high TN removal of 70% due to its repeated cycle of "wet" and "dry" periods, particularly for the treatment of wastewater with high organic content. Moreover, F/D and effluent flow rates of tidal flow constructed wetlands exhibited no significant effect on phosphorus removal in this study. Other techniques, such as pretreatment or post treatment, require further investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Enhanced phosphorus removal from sewage in mesocosm-scale constructed wetland using zeolite as medium and artificial aeration	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						phosphorus removal; natural zeolite; artificial aeration; constructed wetland; sewage treatment	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE-FLOW; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ON-SITE TREATMENT; NATURAL ZEOLITE; PILOT-SCALE; SYSTEMS; PLANTS; CLINOPTILOLITE; ADSORPTION; CAPACITY	Phosphorus (P) contained in sewage maybe removed by mesocosm-scale constructed wetlands (MCW), although removal efficiency is only between 20% and 60%. P removal can be enhanced by increasing wetland adsorption capacity using special media, like natural zeolite, operating under aerobic conditions (oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) above+300mV). The objective of this study was to evaluate P removal in sewage treated by MCW with artificial aeration and natural zeolite as support medium for the plants. The study compared two parallel lines of MCW: gravel and zeolite. Each line consisted in two MCW in series, where the first MCW of each line has artificial aeration. Additionally, four aeration strategies were evaluated. During the operation, the following parameters were measured in each MCW: pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and ORP. Phosphate () and chemical oxygen demand (COD), five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS) and ammonium. (NH (+)(4)-N ) were evaluated in influents and effluents. Plant growth (biomass) and proximate analysis for P content into Schoenoplectus californicus were also performed. The results showed that removal efficiency was 70% in the zeolite medium, presenting significant differences (p<.05) with the results obtained by the gravel medium. Additionally, aeration was found to have a significant effect (p<.05) only in the gravel medium with an increase in up to 30% for removal. Thus, S. californicus contributed to 10-20% of P removal efficiency.

Six different three-stage horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) CWs were designed to examine the effects of artificial aeration and aeration location on the treatment of organics and nitrogen. In a typical configuration (unaerated surface and subsurface flow), single-stage CWs fail to support aerobic and anoxic environments simultaneously. To adjust the distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO) in CWs and to improve the efficiency of sewage water purification, typical HSSF CWs were divided into different sections with enhanced functions. The treatment efficiency of the proposed HSSF CWs was compared with that of typical HSSF CW. Results show that the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and total nitrogen (TN) in typical HSSF CW were 70.3%, 18.4%, and 24.6%, respectively, whereas the removal efficiencies of CW1 with front and rear aeration and anoxic treatment were 90.1%, 99.7%, and 51.3%, respectively, at average influent COD and NH4+-N concentrations of 184.6 and 21.7 mg L-1, respectively. Furthermore, front aeration greatly improved organics and nitrogen removal compared with middle aeration and rear aeration. The oxidized conditions in the HSSF CWs could facilitate efficient biological and biochemical reactions, thus resulting in efficient organics and NH4+-N removal. However, high DO level and lack of carbon resources might restrain denitrification even though NH4+-N removal was enhanced due to aeration. Therefore, TN removal has potential for improvement.

The verification of the Constructed Wetland Model No. 1 implementation in HYDRUS using column experiment data	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Batch operation; Constructed wetland; Column experiment; CWM1; Process-based model		The Constructed Wetland Model No. 1 (CWM1) is a biokinetic model describing microbial dynamics and transformation and degradation processes in subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The implementation of CWM1 in the HYDRUS program package ((c) PC Progress s.r.o.) was verified using data from controlled environment column experiments. These 20-day long batch experiments used synthetic wastewater and were run at different temperatures. Columns were either planted with Carex rostrata Stokes, Schoenoplectus acutus Muhl. Ex Bigelow and with Typha latifolia L or without plants. The minimal adjustment of model parameters between the sixteen setups was targeted and (1) initial bacteria concentrations, (2) initial adsorbed ammonium nitrogen concentrations, and (3) root oxygen loss rates inevitably needed to be set for each columns separately. For all other parameters - including the CWM1 model parameters - identical values have been used. Some biokinetic parameters had to be iteratively adjusted during calibration to allow anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic processes to occur in parallel in order to match measured data. This can be justified by the local effect of root zone re-aeration. The simulation results were evaluated by a new goodness of fit analysis method, deflection analysis. Overall, simulated contaminant concentrations had a very good fit to measured NH4-N and SO4-S concentrations, and a good fit to measured COD concentrations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, TPH removal from sand was adopted as a second response. The optimum conditions for maximum TPH removal were determined through a Box-Behnken Design. Three operational variables, i.e. diesel concentration (0.1, 0.175, 0.25% V-diesel/V-water), aeration rate (0, 1 and 2 L/min) and retention time (14, 43 and 72 days), were investigated by setting TPH removal and diesel concentration as the maximum, retention time within the given range, and aeration rate as the minimum. The optimum conditions were found to be a diesel concentration of 0.25% (V-diesel/V-water), a retention time of 63 days and no aeration with an estimated maximum TPH removal from water and sand of 76.3 and 56.5%, respectively. From a validation test of the optimum conditions, it was found that the maximum TPH removal from contaminated water and sand was 72.5 and 59%, respectively, which was a 5 and 4.4% deviation from the values given by the Box-Behnken Design, providing evidence that S. grossus is a Malaysian native plant that can be used to remediate waste water containing hydrocarbons.

A comprehensive review is accordingly necessary for better understanding of this state-of-the-art-technology for optimum design and new ideas. Considering that the prevailing redox conditions in CWs have a strong effect on removal mechanisms and highly depend on wetland designs and operations, this paper reviews different operation strategies (recirculation, aeration, tidal operation, flow direction reciprocation, and earthworm integration), innovative designs, and configurations (circular-flow corridor wetlands, towery hybrid CWs, baffled subsurface CWs) for the intensifications of the performance. Some new combinations of CWs with technologies in other field for wastewater treatment, such as microbial fuel cell, are also discussed. To improve biofilm development, the selection and utilization of some specific substrates are summarized. Finally, we review the advances in electron donor supply to enhance low C/N wastewater treatment and in thermal insulation against low temperature to maintain CWs running in the cold areas. This paper aims to provide and inspire some new ideas in the development of intensified CWs mainly for the removal of nitrogen and organic matter. The stability and sustainability of these technologies should be further qualified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The CW was composed of six cells in series that include the first settling basin (Cell 1), aeration pond (Cell 2), deep marsh (Cell 3), shallow marsh (Cell 4), deep marsh (Cell 5) and final settling basin (Cell 6). Analysis revealed that the NH4+-N concentration decreased because of ammonification which was then followed by nitrification. The NO3--N and NO2--N were also further reduced by means of microbial activities and plant uptake during photosynthesis. The average nitrogen concentration at the influent was 37,819 kg/year and approximately 45% of that amount exited the CW in the effluent. The denitrification amounted to 34% of the net nitrogen input, whereas the accretion of sediment was only 7%. The biomass uptake of plants was able to retain only 1% of total nitrogen load. In order to improve the nutrient removal by plant uptake, plant coverage in four cells (i.e., Cells 1, 3, 4 and 5) could be increased.

One system (VA-i) was set to intermittent aeration while the other was aerated continuously (VAp-c). Intermittent aeration was provided to VA-i in an 8 h on/4 h off pattern. The intermittently aerated wetland, VA-i, was observed to have 70% less nitrate nitrogen mass outflow than the continuously aerated wetland, VAp-c. Intermittent aeration was shown to increase treatment performance for TN while saving 33% of running energy cost for aeration. Parallel tracer experiments in the two wetlands showed hydraulic characteristics similar to one Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). Intermittent aeration did not significantly affect the hydraulic functioning of the system. Hydraulic efficiencies were 78% for VAp-c and 76% for VA-i. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results indicated that planting densities affected the nitrogen and phosphorus removal of water, and the morphology and physiology of plants, including activity of peroxidise and catalase, content of chlorophyll and soluble protein (SP), the length of root, stem and leaf, tiller number and root density. When planting density increased from 10 to 20 plants per tank, the morphology and physiology of plants, and the nitrogen and phosphorus removal by plants improved slowly, but caused a tiller number decline in individual plants. This variation was significant in autumn, and associated with seasonal variations of plant physiology. During autumn, there were 26 tillers in each plant with 10 plants per tank, compared to 14 tillers per plant with 20 plants per tank. Increase in the nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the plants for 5-10 plants per tank was 5.41 and 0.79g kg(-1), compared to 1.17 and 0.12g kg(-1) for 10-20 plants per tank, respectively.

Constructed wetlands were developed to mimic the physical and biological filtering functions of natural systems for the treatment of human and animal waste under controlled conditions. Previous studies on the effect of constructed wetlands on native invertebrate populations have concentrated almost exclusively on mosquitoes. Here, we present the first study investigating the relationship between vegetation cover and aeration regime, and the diversity and abundance of nematodes and springtails (Collembola) in a constructed wetland designed to treat dairy farm wastewater in northwestern Vermont. We investigated four treatment cells differing in aeration regime and vegetation cover, but equally overlaid by a layer of compost to provide insulation. Analysis showed that nematodes were most abundant in the nonplanted and nonaerated cells, and that bacterivorous nematodes dominated the community in all cells. Springtails were found to be most numerous in the planted and nonaerated cells. We hypothesize that the vegetation provided differing environmental niches that supported a more diverse system of bacteria and fungi, as well as offering protection from predators and inclement weather. Nematodes were likely imported with the original compost material, while springtails migrated into the cells either via air, water, or direct locomotion.

Nitrogen Removal from Wastewater by an Aerated Subsurface-Flow Constructed Wetland in Cold Climates	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						subsurface-flow wetland; aeration; ammonia; nitrogen removal; vegetation; cold climate	NITRIFICATION	The objective of this study was to assess the role of cyclic aeration, vegetation, and temperature on nitrogen removal by subsurface-flow engineered wetlands. Aeration was shown to enhance total nitrogen and ammonia removal and to enhance removal of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and phosphorus. Effluent ammonia and total nitrogen concentrations were significantly lower in aerated wetland cells when compared with unaerated cells. There was no significant difference in nitrogen removal between planted and unplanted cells. Effluent total nitrogen concentrations ranged from 9 to 12 mg N/L in the aerated cells and from 23 to 24 mg N/L in unaerated cells. Effluent ammonia concentrations ranged from 3 to 7 mg N/L in aerated wetland cells and from 22 to 23 mg N/L in unaerated cells. For the conditions tested, temperature had only a minimal effect on effluent ammonia or total nitrogen concentrations. The tanks-in-series and the PkC* models predicted the general trends in effluent ammonia and total nitrogen concentrations, but did not do well predicting short-term variability. Rate coefficients for aerated systems were 2 to 10 times greater than those for unaerated systems.

The trickling filter was packed with coarse zeolite segregated by 3 thin iron scraps layers, referred to as the Iron modified Zeolite Trickling Filter (IZTF). The effective particle size of the zeolite ranged 3-5 mm, and the zeolite to iron scraps ratio was 95:5 by dry weight. The MSL was a layered filter system consisted of Zeolite permeable layers (ZPL) and Soil mixture block (SMB) layers in alternated form. Simulated septic tank effluent was fed into the apparatus through a perforated pipe on top of the trickling filter at a loading rate of 440, 640 and 920 L m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and dropped into the MSL. Total removal rates of CODcr, TP, Ammonium, and TN ranged 90.3%-95.2%, 92.0%-94.0%, 85.1%-86.9%, and 58.9%-63.8% with mean final effluent concentrations of 12, 0.28, 5.66, and 21.0 mg L-1, respectively at mean hydraulic loading rate of 920 L m(-2) d(-1) and under relatively stable conditions. The system operated without any sign of oxygen shortness even at the maximum loading rate of 250 g CODcr m(-2) d(-1) and 40 gNH(4)(+)-N m(-2) d(-1) without artificial aeration, and clogging did not occur during the study owing to better water dispersion of the MSL, which indicated that the hybrid system could operate well for COD removal and nitrification with little management and labor demand. A comparative study also showed that the IZTF with identical total packing height and iron proportions performed better than the single MSL in TP removal, and the aerobic condition as well as the partial high Fe:P ratio was hypothesized to be the dominant factor for that.

This technology was applied for the first time to treat POME in order to decrease biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). In this study, two different concentrations of POME (low and high) were treated with Vetiver plants for 2 weeks. The results showed that Vetiver was able to reduce the BOD up to 90% in low concentration POME and 60% in high concentration POME, while control sets (without plant) only was able to reduce 15% of BOD. The COD reduction was 94% in low concentration POME and 39% in high concentration POME, while control just shows reduction of 12%. Morphologically, maximum root and shoot lengths were 70 cm, the number of tillers and leaves was 344 and 86, and biomass production was 4.1 kg m(-2). These results showed that VST was effective in reducing BOD and COD in POME. The treatment in low concentration was superior to the high concentration. Furthermore, biomass of plant can be considered as a promising raw material for biofuel production while high amount of biomass was generated in low concentration of POME.

In this study, two three-stage hybrid wetland systems were configured to treat aquaculture effluent. The two systems added with or without artificial aeration were operated under a high HLR (8.0 m/day) with a short retention time (0.96 h). By the results, COD could be effectively removed by both the systems, and it had been significantly enhanced by continuous aeration (air:water ratio being 7.5:1). For nitrogen (N) compounds, NH4+-N concentration of outflow compared to the inflow was elevated in most cases under the non-aerated condition, but an opposite trend was observed for the aerated state, which indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO) required for nitrification in the natural bed was more insufficient at the high organic loading rate. TN mass removal was efficient without aeration, but it significantly declined after enhancement, possibly due to the resuspension of trapped organic N promoted by the strong airflow. The artificial aeration also significantly improved the treatment performance on phosphorus. By canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), the first-order removal rate constants of various pollutants were significantly correlated to the measured environment of the inflow. Under the high constant HLR accompanied by low DO, pollutant loading rate became the first dependent factor on removal rate for such a rapid filtration system.

The design comprises a sedimentation tank for pretreatment, and a vertical flow volcanic gravel wetland bed equipped with a recirculation device. Eighteen rainfall events were monitored in 2012. The treatment system achieved total removal efficiencies of 99.4, 81, 50, and 86% for suspended solids, organicmatter, nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, and 29, 68, and 25% for copper, zinc, and lead, respectively, at a 3-day hydraulic residence time. In the wetland bed, the removal of ammonia, total nitrogen, and zinc were improved by recirculation. Plant uptake provided 18% of nitrogen removal and 39% of phosphorus removal. During the experimental stage, only 1.4% of the pore volume in substrate was reduced due to clogging, implying that the wetland can operate without clogging for a relatively long period.

The successive anaerobic and aerobic treatment of the UFCW reactors could effectively remove color, organic matters and intermediate aromatic amines simultaneously in a single reactor. With influent 50 mg/L of MO, the removal efficiencies of COD and MO were 91 and 75 %, respectively, in the aerated wetland reactor, whereas the removal efficiencies were 86 and 93 %, respectively, in the non-aerated wetland reactor. The aerated wetland reactor outperformed the non-aerated wetland reactor in the removal of organic matters and aromatic amines. The accumulation of aromatic amines in the non-aerated wetland reactor was observed as shown in the increase of ratio absorbance at 270 nm/465 nm and UV-Vis spectra analysis.

Effect of aeration and mixed culture of Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia natans on removal of wastewater pollutants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Aeration; Eichhornia crassipes; Removal; Salvinia natans; Wastewater pollutants	CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEM; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; NITROGEN REMOVAL; HYACINTH; PERFORMANCE; EFFLUENT; SEWAGE; PHYTOREMEDIATION	An attempt was made to investigate the impact of aeration and mixed culture of Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia natans on the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants from municipal wastewater. Since treatment of wastewater generated from industrial and domestic sources have made mandatory before its release to rivers, ponds or streams. This study focused on the comparison between removal potentials of non-aerated and aerated cultures of E. crassipes and S. natans grown individually and in mixed culture. Highest removal potential of aerated and mixed plant culture was recorded as 84.5% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), 83.2% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 26.6% of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 -N), 53.0% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and 56.6% of phosphate-phosphorous (PO43 -P). A positive and significant relationship was established between percent removal of the pollutants and retention time. It was observed that 36 h of retention time was sufficient to minimize BOD5 from 154.5 +/- 1.36 to 23.9 +/- 0.94 mg L-1 and COD from 309.0 +/- 2.2 to 51.9 +/- 3.9 mg L-1, which were for below permissible levels of 30 mg L-1 BOD and 250 mg L-1 COD. Thus, a culture of E. crassipes and S. natans might be utilized for the removal of organic (BOD and COD) and inorganic (NO3--N, TKN and PO43--P) pollutants from municipal wastewater. In addition, a removal of pollutant may further be enhanced with the aeration (0.5 Lmin(-1)) of wastewater. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Recirculation or artificial aeration in vertical flow constructed wetlands: A comparative study for treating high load wastewater	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Vertical subsurface flow constructed wetlands; Intermittent aeration; Recirculation; Simultaneous nitrification-denitrification	INFLUENT COD/N RATIOS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; SYSTEM; NITRIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFLUENT; MODES	Vertical subsurface-flow constructed wetlands at pilot-scale have been applied to treat high hydraulic and organic loads by implementing the following configurations: (1) intermittent recirculation of the treated wastewater from the bottom to the top of the bed, (2) intermittent artificial aeration supplied at the bottom of the bed and (3) the combination of both. These configurations were operated with a saturated bottom layer for a 6 h-treatment phase, followed by a free drainage phase prior to a new feeding. COD removal efficiency was 85-90% in all the configurations and removed loads were 54-70 gCOD m(-2) d(-1). The aerated and recirculated wetland resulted in a higher total nitrogen removal (8.6 gN m(-2) d(-1)) due to simultaneous nitrification/denitrification, even in the presence of intermittent aeration (6.8 Nm(3) m(-2) d(-1)). The extra investment needed for implementing aeration/recirculation would be compensated for by a reduction of the surface area per population equivalent, which decreased to 1.5 m(2)/PE.

J	Wu, YF; Zhu, WB; Lu, XW				Wu, Yifeng; Zhu, Wenbo; Lu, Xiwu			Identifying key parameters in a novel multistep bio-ecological wastewater treatment process for rural areas	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rural wastewater treatment; Nutrient removal; Multistep bio-ecological system; Water dropping aeration; Hydrophyte filter bed	LOW-COST PROCEDURE; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; TREATMENT SYSTEM; DOMESTIC SEWAGE; TREATMENT PERFORMANCE; ANAEROBIC TREATMENT; CHINA; ONSITE; FLOW	With the goals of enhancing the removal of pollutants while reducing the cost of treatment, a novel, multistep bio-ecological A(2)O-H system for rural wastewater treatment consisting of a biological unit (modified anaerobic/anoxic/oxic, A(2)O) and an ecological post-treatment unit (hydrophyte filter bed, HFB) was developed. Four reactors, including two series large height/diameter ratio upflow anaerobic biofilm reactors (LUAB), an anoxic biofilm reactor (ABR), a five-cell water-dropping aeration submerged biofilm reactor (WDASB), and the HFB, were employed in the A(2)O-H system. Key parameters for each step were identified based on their performances for further application in the project. Concerning rural domestic sewage, the LUAB presented good organic removal and gas generation rates under a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3d or within an organic load rate (OLR) of 0.10-0.15 kg COD/(m(3) d). The HRT and OLR for the WDASB were evaluated to be 2-3 h and 1.0-1.5 kg COD/(m(3) d), respectively, for organic matter and ammonia removal. Complete nitrogen removal through denitrification occurred in the ABR with a reflux ratio of 100% and a HRT of 6 h. The HFB presented a higher nutrient removal for the hydraulic load rate (HLR) of 0.2-0.3 m(3) /(m(2) d) without clogging. Furthermore, the experimental results of the A(2)O-H system for the consecutive flow model condition showed that average removal efficiencies were 88% for COD, 85% for ammonia, 66% for TN, 89% for TP, and 87% for TSS. The pollutant concentrations of the effluent from the bio-ecological A(2)O-H system were lower than the rigorous regulated values of the Class IA in the China National Standard GB18918-2002. Therefore, the multistep bio-ecological A(2)O-H system is a promising alternative for rural wastewater treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The sub-surface flow constructed wetland (SSFCW) was planted with the native Malaysian plant of Scirpus grossus. The best removal of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) from diesel contaminated water in the SSFCW reactors was found to be 84.1%, 86.3% and 88.3% for 0.1%, 0.175% and 0.25% diesel concentrations, respectively, with 1 L/min aeration treatment. Aeration supply can also improve the plant growth and bacterial population, indicating that combining plants and bacteria together with aeration represents better treatment for water contaminated with diesel. According to statistical analyses, 1 L/min aeration is a cost-effective operation parameter for TPH removal in diesel-contaminated water using S. grossus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The designs differ in terms of flow direction, degree of media saturation, media type, loading regime, and aeration mechanism. Seven systems were constructed as planted and unplanted pairs, in order to elucidate the role of common reed (Phrag-mites australis) in these technologies. The facility is unique in the fact that it is located adjacent to the wastewater treatment plant for the nearby village, enabling all of the pilot-scale systems to receive the same wastewater. The construction of the Langenreichenbach research facility is placed within the overarching discipline of ecological engineering. An overview of the treatment wetland design spectrum (ranging from passive to highly intensified designs) is discussed and the specific designs implemented at Langenreichenbach are presented in detail, along with the internal sampling methods for both saturated and unsaturated systems.

This paper reviews the pertinent literature regarding oxygen transfer and consumption in subsurface flow treatment wetlands, and discusses the factors that influence oxygen availability. We also provide first results from a pilot-scale research facility in Langenreichenbach, Germany (15 individual systems of various designs, both with and without plants). Based on the approach given in Kadlec and Wallace (2009), areal-based oxygen consumption rates for horizontal flow systems were estimated to be between 0.5 and 12.9 g/m(2)-d; for vertical flow systems between 7.9 and 58.6 g/m(2)-d; and for intensified systems between 10.9 and 87.5 g/m(2)-d. In general, as the level of intensification increases, so does subsurface oxygen availability. The use of water or air pumps can result in systems with smaller area requirements (and better treatment performance), but it comes at the cost of increased electricity inputs. As the treatment wetland technology envelope expands, so must methods to compare oxygen consumption rates of traditional and intensified SSF treatment wetland designs. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

This study compared the removal rates and internal dynamics of Escherichia coli in a range of commonly used and emerging subsurface flow systems designed for secondary treatment of domestic sewage. Fifteen pilot-scale units were loaded with primary treated sewage in Langenreichenbach, Germany and monitored at the inlet, outlet and a several internal sample points between August 2010 and December 2011. The compared systems spanned a range of energetic intensification levels, including passive horizontal flow (HF) beds (25 cm versus 50 cm deep), moderately-intensified unsaturated pulse-loaded (12 versus 24 times per day) vertical flow (VF) beds (gravel versus sand media), and highly-intensified beds with aeration (HF versus VF) or reciprocating fill and drain hydraulics. Planted (Phrag-mites australis) and unplanted forms were compared for all designs except for the reciprocating system (unplanted only). In general, there was no significant effect of vegetation on E. coli removal. Despite receiving the highest loading rates (131-146 L/m(2) d), the aerated HF systems and the reciprocating system achieved the highest log concentration reductions (2.8-4.0 log(10)) and the lowest effluent E. coli concentrations (geometric mean less than 1 x 10(4) MPN/100 mL). The gravel-based VF beds had the lowest log concentration reduction (0.8 logio) and highest effluent concentrations (6.4-8.9 x 10(5) MPN/100 mL) at a hydraulic loading rate of 96 L/m(2) d. The design type had an extremely significant effect on areal mass removal rates, with the passive HF beds having the lowest removal rates (50 cm depth significantly better than 25 cm), followed by the unsaturated VF systems (which were not significantly different from one another), while the aerated and reciprocating systems had the highest removal rates. Within the unsaturated VF beds, the use of sand versus gravel substrate, or hourly versus bi-hourly loading regime in the sand-based systems, had no effect on areal load removal. The internal concentration profiles were not significantly different between the unsaturated VF designs, with the exception of the hourly-loaded, planted bed with sand media which had a more rapid rate of concentration reduction with depth. In the HF beds, the internal E. coli concentration reduction was significantly faster in the aerated beds than in the non-aerated beds. Depth and plants had no significant effect on the internal concentration profiles within the non-aerated HF beds. Within the aerated systems, horizontal-flow achieved better E. coli removal than vertical-flow. Subsurface flow ecotechnologies offer great potential as robust and low-maintenance solutions for reducing the pathogen risk associated with domestic wastewater. The intensified systems produced effluent potentially suitable for restricted surface irrigation, at the cost of higher energy consumption, while the effluent from the other design types would require subsurface irrigation or further disinfection prior to reuse.

The data obtained showed that the removal rates of DON, NH4+-N and TN were significantly temperature-dependent. The substrate ureases activity and microbial nitrification intensity dropped as temperature decreased. Urease activity and nitrification intensity in planted wetlands were distinctly higher than that in unplanted wetlands. DO concentration in mid- and upper-layer of the wetlands had greater seasonal variation than that in bottom-layer. The net photosynthetic rate and evaporation rate of reeds were both significantly positively correlated to temperature. Consequently, in order to obtain more consistent year round nutrient removal, it is suggested that some appropriate heat- preservation measures are used to cover the surface of the wetlands, cold resistant plants that are active year round, and enhanced aeration in mid- and upper layer should be adopted.

In this study, we investigated the growth features of six commonly used wetland plants, namely, Canna indica (Ci), Iris pseudacorus (Ip), Pontederia cordata (Pc), Cyperus alternifolius (Ca), Vetiveria zizanioides (Vz), and Pennisetum purpureum (Pp) that were treated with sewage. After 50 days of treatment, plants treated with diluted sewage, especially Ci and Ip, had a better growth rate than those receiving undiluted sewage. The abilities of different wetland plants to directly take up nitrogen (9.28-17.26 mg g(-1) DW) and phosphorus (0.89-2.18 mg g(-1) DW) were species-specific, but within each species, uptake was similar between diluted and undiluted sewage. Total biomass determined the total accumulation of N and P in plant tissues. The removal of pollutants, except nitrate and organic matter, was dependent on both plant species and sewage dilution. The first-order rate constants (K) for nitrate and organic matter were similar between diluted and undiluted sewage. Differences in the removal of nitrate and biochemical oxygen demand among plant species were due to differences in chlorophyll fluorescence, a photosynthetic characteristic, leading to different root lengths. The amounts of oxygen release to the rhizosphere (radial oxygen loss [ROL]) by wetland plant was directly governed by total root biomass and significantly influenced the removal of ammonia and total dissolved phosphorus via processes such as plant uptake and nitrification. The removal of total phosphorus and chemical oxygen demand resulted from the filtration by root systems. A non-species-specific significant positive correlation was found between ROL (12.50-205.25 mu mol O-2 d(-1) g(-1) DWroot) and root porosity (9.95-32.49%). These results suggest that the root features and photosynthetic characteristic of wetland plants are important determinants of sewage treatment efficiency and could be used to select appropriate plants for constructed wetland systems.

J	Sapsford, DJ				Sapsford, D. J.			New perspectives on the passive treatment of ferruginous circumneutral mine waters in the UK	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Iron oxidation; Carbon dioxide degassing; Settling velocity; Hydraulic efficiency; Constructed wetlands; Settling ponds	FERROUS IRON; OXIDATION; KINETICS; FE(II)	This paper examines major physico-chemical processes during the passive treatment of ferruginous circumneutral drainage from abandoned coal mines in the UK. Data collected over several years of studies on mine water treatment systems shed new light on the relative importance of hydraulics, settling velocity, Fe(II) oxidation rates and cascade aeration, which, in turn, informs the design of future systems. This paper demonstrates that (1) the complex settling behaviour of Fe(III) precipitates may be described by a first-order volumetric process and that settling rate is different for different mine waters; (2) the hydraulic efficiency (ratio of time to peak tracer concentration to nominal residence time) of the settling ponds studied was widely variable at low flow rates in comparison to constructed wetlands; (3) aeration cascades contribute dissolved oxygen and lead to a rise in pH due to CO2 degassing, which are very important in reducing the required time for iron oxidation and removal; (4) for at least 10 of the 30 sites examined, modelling of the rates of Fe(II) oxidation and particulate settling reveals that removal of iron is primarily dependent on settling rate; and (5) that substantial increases in pH can be brought about by forced aeration of mine water over several hours. Findings of this study apply to the majority of coal mine water treatment sites in the UK and may have broader application to other ferruginous waters with circumneutral pH or after treatment to increase pH.

J	Lopsik, K				Lopsik, K.			Life cycle assessment of small-scale constructed wetland and extended aeration activated sludge wastewater treatment system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Sewage; Light expanded clay aggregate; Environmental impact; Impact 2002+; ReCiPe	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; TREATMENT PLANTS; TECHNOLOGIES; PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL; OPTIONS; LCA	Wastewater treatment plants help to reduce negative impact on the environment by improving the quality of effluent. Different technologies are used in wastewater treatment, and one of the tasks is to find the most environmentally sound option, taking into account the use of resources and energy during construction and operation of the treatment system. The aim of the study is to assess environmental impacts from two different types of small-scale wastewater treatment systems, a constructed wetland and extended aeration activated sludge treatment system using Life Cycle Assessment method. The system boundaries include construction and operation phases. Assessment has been carried out using SimaPro software and Impact 2002+ and ReCiPe assessment methods with characterisation and normalisation stages. The results show that the main negative impact of constructed wetland is caused by the construction phase and use of lightweight expanded clay aggregate to construct the hybrid filter. Impacts from extended aeration activated sludge treatment system are mainly caused from the use of electricity and the quality of the effluent, therefore, the use phase has a larger impact on the life cycle. Since a large amount of energy is used to produce lightweight expanded clay aggregate, the impact of 1 population equivalent of constructed wetland is larger than the impact of extended aeration activated sludge treatment system. Constructed wetland dominates in human toxicity, acidification, land use, ozone layer depletion and the use of non-renewable resources categories. Extended aeration activated sludge treatment system dominates in categories associated with eutrophication and ecotoxicity.

The lowest average chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) removal efficiencies of 87, 84 and 73%, respectively, were obtained in the ryegrass cultivated system operating with a non-aerated influent. However, ryegrass cultivation did not influence the removal efficiency of organic matter. Artificial aeration of the CPW, prior to its injection in the CW, did not improve the removal efficiencies of organic matter. On other hand it did contribute to increase the instantaneous rate at which the maximum COD removal efficiency was reached. Although aeration did not result in greater organic matter removal efficiencies, it is important to consider the benefits of aeration on the removal of the other compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Almost complete nitrification was obtained by intermittent aeration, which well developed alternate anaerobic and aerobic conditions for nitrification and denitrification. Sufficient carbon source supply resulted from influent COD/N ratio of 10 simultaneously obtained high removals of COD (96%), ammonia nitrogen (99%) and total nitrogen (90%) in intermittently aerated VFCWs. In all non-aerated VFCWs, poor nitrification was observed due to oxygen deficiency whilst high COD/N ratios further led to lower COD and nitrogen removal efficiency. The results suggest that intermittent aeration combined with high influent COD/N ratios could achieve high nitrogen removal in VFCWs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two 3.7 L CW-MFCs have been constructed to treat swine wastewater with one (System 1) operated in batch mode while the other (System 2) was operated in continuous, upward flow mode and incorporated air diffusion heads to aerate the cathode. System 1 removed, on average, 71.5% of COD (with initial concentration of 3190-7080 mg/L) and produced a peak power density of 12.83 mu W/m(2).

A field-scale experiment was undertaken to remediate a heavily polluted river using a combined engineering approach of aeration, microorganisms, biological aerated filtration, artificial biofilms and ecological floating beds. Prior to remediation, the river water was black, anoxic and highly sulfidic. With remediation, the chemical oxygen demand decreased from similar to 250 to similar to 50 mg L-1, NH4+-N decreased from similar to 27 to similar to 4 mg L-1, sulfide decreased from similar to 3 to similar to 0.3 mg L-1, and total suspended solids decreased from similar to 270 to similar to 40 mg L-1. At the same time, dissolved oxygen increased from similar to 0.1 to similar to 3.5 mg L-1, and water clarity increased from similar to 6 to similar to 40 cm. Furthermore, the unpleasant odor emanating from the polluted river was also stopped, and local farmers have begun using the water for irrigation. This field-scale experiment thus indicates the potential usefulness of this combined engineering approach to remediate heavily polluted rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we employed two artificial aeration modes including continuous aeration (CA) and intermittent aeration (IA) in lab-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) to investigate the nitrogen removal performance with different influent COD/N ratios. The artificial aeration significantly enhanced NH4+-N removal, especially for the wetland units with higher COD/N ratios. The variations of aeration modes and COD/N ratios also had a great effect on nitrogen removal. The IA units had a better performance on nitrogen removal compared to CA units when the COD/N ratio ranged from 5 to 10. Plant biomass and nitrogen accumulation by plant were also studied. It was observed that plants in IA and CA had less biomass and nitrogen uptake at lower COD/N ratios, but plants in IA could achieve a better performance with higher COD/N ratios.

A conventional SFCW B and a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS C) were also constructed for comparison. Alternate anaerobic and aerobic conditions were well developed by intermittent aeration. High removal of organic pollutants (29.3 g m(-2) d(-1)), ammonium nitrogen (3.5 g m(-2) d(-1)) and total nitrogen (3.3 g m(-2) d(-1)) were obtained simultaneously in SFCW A compared with SFCW B and SWIS C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis proved that the intermittent aeration obviously enhanced the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in SFCW A. These results suggest that intermittent aeration strategy is reliable to enhance the performance of SFCWs in decentralized rural sewage treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Plants were hydroponically cultivated in six purifying tanks (aerated, non-aerated) and the characteristics of the plants were measured. Water quality improvements in purifying tanks were evaluated by comparing to the control tanks. The results showed that continuous aeration affected the plant morphology and physiology. The lengths of the roots, petioles and leaf limbs in aeration conditions were shorter than in non-aeration conditions. Chlorophyll and soluble protein contents of the leaf limbs in aerated tanks decreased, while peroxidase and catalase activities of roots tissues increased. In spring and summer, effects of aeration on the plants were less than in autumn. Total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4 +-N) in aerated tanks were lower than in non-aerated tanks, while total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved phosphorus (DP) increased in spring and summer. In autumn, effects of aeration on the plants became more significant. TN, NH4 +-N, TP and DP became higher in aerated tanks than in non-aerated tanks in autumn. This work provided evidences for regulating aeration techniques based on seasonal variations of the plant physiology in restoring polluted stagnant water.

Performance of Air Suction Flow Biofilm Reactor in Treating Municipal-Strength Wastewater	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Air suction flow biofilm reactor (ASF-BR); Decentralized wastewater treatment; Attached growth; Nitrification; Passive aeration	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NITRIFICATION; SYSTEM	The provision of technologies that can meet increasingly stringent wastewater discharge standards while reducing energy, operation, and maintenance costs is vital to government, local authorities, industry, and the public at large. The air suction flow biofilm reactor (ASF-BR) is a novel batch biofilm technology suitable for treating wastewaters from municipal, industrial, and agricultural sources. This paper presents an investigation into the performance of a laboratory-scale ASF-BR in treating municipal-strength wastewater over two operational periods-Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 concentrated on organic carbon removal and nitrification, whereas Phase 2 included an anoxic step to achieve denitrification. The operation of the unit was also investigated by monitoring organic carbon and nitrogen in the reactors during a number of treatment cycles. In Phases 1 and 2 (29 and 124 days of steady-state operation, respectively) of this laboratory study, using a municipal-strength synthetic wastewater, the average influent total chemical oxygen demand (CODt) was 288 and 313 mg/L, whereas the average influent filtered COD (CODf) was 127 and 148 mg/L, respectively. The average CODf removal rates were 92 and 79% during Phases 1 and 2, respectively. Average nitrogen removals during Phases 1 and 2 of greater than 95% ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) were achieved. By reducing the number of pumping cycles during the aerobic step, the overall energy consumed was reduced by 37.5% during Phase 2 while achieving similar results. On the basis of these positive initial results, a pilot-scale reactor has been constructed at a local wastewater-treatment facility, and commissioning of the unit is currently underway.

Influence of the stone organization to avoid clogging in horizontal subsurface-flow treatment wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wetland; Channel; Aeration; Clog; Subsurface; Plug flow	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER; SEWERS; IMPACT; DIGESTION; SYSTEMS	The major issue associated with horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment is clogging. This paper shows the research conducted to determine if a change in the design of the bed of stones and in the kind of these stones at wetlands contributes to prevent clogging. The research was carried out with real domestic wastewater. Two separate cases with different types of stones and different layouts were tested in a pilot channel. The changes incorporated in this experience against the designs typically used in subsurface wetlands have been implementing a plug flow, the use of cornerstones, the suitable stone organization and the design of a natural aeration circuit. An effective separation is obtained between the sludge falling to the bottom of the reactor, and the water above, which is oxygenated by the air drawn through the aeration circuit. The most significant result is the absence of silting in the transport of water. The natural aeration obtained was sufficient to prevent the growth of anaerobic processes from reaching a certain depth and hence no exopolymers are released which would otherwise facilitate anaerobic bacterial colonization of the stones to such a level that siltation appears.

Effect of artificial aeration on tertiary nitrification in a full-scale subsurface horizontal flow constructed wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Aeration; Constructed wetlands; Carbon; Cost; Dissolved oxygen; Nitrification	SOLIDS ACCUMULATION; VERTICAL-FLOW; COLD-CLIMATE; PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL; SYSTEMS	A full scale comparison of a newly commissioned artificially aerated horizontal subsurface, flow constructed wetland and a non-aerated bed of identical design was conducted to determine the efficacy of artificial aeration on tertiary nitrification. The works serves a population equivalent of 400; each bed is 100 m(2) and has a mean hydraulic loading rate of 0.27 m(3)/m(2)/d. During the first 9 months of operation the wetlands received inlet loadings of NH4-N: 3.1 +/- 2.4 g/m(2)/d, CBOD5: 2.8 +/- 2.0 gO(2)/m(2)/d, chemical oxygen demand (COD): 19.4 +/- 11.2 g/m(2)/d and total suspended solids (TSS): 6.6 +/- 5.0 g/m(2)/d (mean +/- standard deviation, n = 17). Results demonstrated enhanced nitrification in the aerated bed with 99% mass removal up to the maximum tested loading rate of 10.1 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(2)/d. In comparison, an ammonia removal of 59% was observed in the non-aerated bed up to a loading rate of 1.6 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(2)/d beyond which performance deteriorated. Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids removal were seen to be statistically similar between the beds while a significant difference was observed in terms of mixing pattern, quantity and characteristics of the accumulated solids and hydraulic conductivity. The suitability of the technology was also assessed through comparison of cost, carbon footprint and land area relative to alternative upgrading options. Retrofitting existing horizontal subsurface flow wetlands was shown to be the most cost effective solution delivering the required treatment at 38% of the cost of the least expensive alternatives.

This study focused on nitrogen removal by Ceratophyllum demersum. Treatments included raw municipal wastewater (RMW), treated municipal wastewater (TMW), and diluted fresh latex (DFL). Results showed the Ceratophyllum demersum reduced ammonium and nitrate more than 62% and 41.66%, respectively, from three treatments in the first six days of non-aeration. Results showed that in aeration conditions the concentration of ammonium and nitrate were increased in aquatic solution after a second and third six day period of aeration, because Ceratophyllum demersum uptake 100% of lead from solution.

Simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and nitrogen in five batch-operated vertical flow constructed wetlands under different operating conditions was investigated. Alternate aerobic and anaerobic regions were created well with intermittent aeration. Four-month experiments showed that the wetland-applied intermittent aeration combined with step feeding strategy (reactor E) greatly improved the removal of organics, ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and total nitrogen (TN) simultaneously, which were 97, 96, and 82 %, respectively. It was much better than non-aerated reactors A and B and outperformed intermittently aerated reactor D without step feeding. Continuous aeration (reactor C) significantly enhanced the organics removal and nitrification, but it limited the TN removal (29 %) seriously as a result of low denitrification level, and the high operation cost remained a question. The effect of plants was confirmed in this study, and the monitoring data showed that the plants could grow normally. Intermittent aeration as well as step feeding had no obvious influence on the growth of wetland plants in this study.

Root-associated biofilms were characterised regarding methane-oxidising bacteria (MOB) by immuno labelling. Runs of O2pp showed distinct diurnal patterns repeating day-to-day. Soon after sunrise O2pp increased steeply to around 185 hPa, remained on this level over mid-day and decreased exponentially over night to about 80 hPa. Root surfaces were densely packed with bacteria of which 34-37% accounted for potential MOB. This emphasises the importance of the oxic rhizosphere in the degradation of organic matter and methane oxidation and diurnal fluctuation of O2pp may implicate for variation of biogeochemical processes involved in wastewater treatment.

J	Zhao, XH; Liu, L				Zhao, Xinhua; Liu, Lei			A comparative estimate of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from two types of constructed wetlands in Tianjin, China	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; GHG emission; Wastewater treatment; Vertical flow; Horizontal flow	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITROUS-OXIDE; METHANE EMISSIONS; RESOURCES USE; REMOVAL; FLOW; PERFORMANCE; MITIGATION; INVENTORY; PLANT	Constructed wetlands (CWs) are widely used for wastewater treatment, but may also be sources of greenhouse gas (GHG). This study focuses on comparing the GHG emissions from a vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) and a horizontal flow constructed wetland (HFCW) in the city of Tianjin, China. Two methods are used in this paper to estimate the indirect and direct GHG emissions. It is found that the VFCW emits 0.09, 1.34, and 3.31 kg equivalent CO2 (CO2 Eq.) to remove 1.00 m(3) wastewater, 1.00 kg COD, and 1.00 kg BOD in the studied life cycle, respectively, in contrast to 0.18, 2.10, and 5.42 kg CO2 Eq. for the HFCW. The results indicate that the adoption of VFCW is a more effective option with respect to GHG emissions when treating the same amount of pollutants. In addition, the operation phase which includes GHG emissions from water treatment process and energy consumption for pump dominates the GHG emissions. For different kinds of GHG from CWs, CO2 dominates the influence on climate change. The CH4 and N2O emissions should also deserve more attention due to their greater global warming potential. This paper further suggests that GHG emissions can be mitigated in the design, construction, and operation stages through some feasible measures. It would reduce GHG emissions in CWs by adopting hybrid CW system (e.g. HF-VF or VF-HF) or choosing suitable plant species which can mitigate GHG emissions. In addition, aeration could contribute to the control of GHG emissions from CWs.

Options for managing hypoxic blackwater events in river systems: A review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved oxygen; Forested floodplain; Litter accumulation; Lowland river; Mitigation	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LOWLAND RIVER; FLOOD PULSE; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; MATTER DECOMPOSITION; SEMIARID FLOODPLAIN; AIR ENTRAINMENT; SUBSURFACE-FLOW	Blackwater events are characterised by a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the water column. They occur naturally in lowland rivers with forested floodplains and bring a variety of benefits to both aquatic and floodplain biota. However, particularly when accompanied by high temperatures, respiration of the organic carbon may cause blackwater to become hypoxic. This may lead to a range of lethal and sub-lethal effects on the aquatic biota. We review the current scientific knowledge concerning the management of blackwater and hypoxia, and examine how this knowledge may be applied to the management of hypoxic blackwater events in lowland river systems. A range of management options, which aim to either prevent the development of hypoxic blackwater or to reintroduce oxygen into deoxygenated waters, are reported. Mitigation options that may be applicable to lowland river systems include manipulating the season and magnitude of floods in regulated rivers, increasing roughness in flow paths, establishing oxygenated refugia for aquatic biota and introducing hydraulic structures that promote turbulence and re-aeration. With climatic changes trending towards a scenario where extreme events leading to the development of hypoxic blackwater are more probable, it is now vital to validate and optimise management options on local and regional scales and work towards closing knowledge gaps. With judicious management of regulated rivers, it is possible to minimise the impacts of hypoxic flows while preserving the benefits brought to floodplain and river ecosystems by seasonal flooding and carbon exchange.

The experimental result indicates that DO concentration in self-aeration constructed wetlands is 0.1mg/L higher than that in artificially intensified aeration wetlands, and the removal rate for COD reaches over 85%,which is about 2% higher than that of artificial aeration wetlands. This shows that the built self-aeration constructed wetland system can increase oxygen supply capacity in the wetland, and increase the purification efficiency of the wetland system for COD in wastewater.

However, oxygen inside CW beds is frequently low especially when substrate clogging problems appear after long-term operation, and this may become a limited factor for the treatment of wastewaters. Aimed at dealing with the issue of a low oxygen content in CW systems, two laboratory-scale vertical-flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) with and without an aeration device (called VFCW-a and VFCW-c, respectively) were designed in this study to test the contribution of supplementary aeration to the treatment of decentralized domestic wastewater. Results showed that under the intermittent operation of about 45 days, two VFCW units were successfully started up by using activated sludge as seed sludge. Compared to VFCW-c, VFCW-a had a better resistance ability to organic shock loads and its removal function could be effectively recovered within a short period after the introduction of organic shock loads. Under intermittent operation with a 12 h idling time, the ideal hydraulic retention time (HRT) of VFCW-a was 42 h, about 6 h shorter than that of VFCW-c. Likewise, under intermittent operation with 42 h HRT, the ideal idling time of VFCW-a was 12 h, still about 6 h shorter than that of VFCW-c. Under intermittent operation with HRT-42 h and an idling time of 12 h, SS, COD, TN and TP removal efficiencies in VFCW-a could reach 81.2%, 85%, 89.9% and 77.9%, respectively. The VFCW unit with supplementary aeration is an efficient innovation for the treatment of decentralized domestic wastewater.

For this reason, CWs were constructed measuring 0.6 m x 0.5 m x 2.0 m (H x L x W) and filled with pea gravel to a height of 0.55 m. The experiment was carried out considering a completely randomized design (CRD). Each variant of the experiment was replicated 10 times for each one of two replicates, implying in a total of 20 replicates, and 4 CWs characterized as follows: (i) ryegrass cultivated systems operating with an aerated influent (aiCWc), (ii) non-cultivated systems operating with an aerated influent (aiCW*), (iii) ryegrass cultivated system operating with a non-aerated influent (CWc), and (iv) non-cultivated systems operating with a non-aerated influent (CW*). For oxygenation of the CPW which would be supplied as aerated CPW in two treatments, an aeration system was implanted in the storage tank, consisting of a submerged Sarlobetter S520 pump with a flow of 0.52 m(3) h(-1), a gravel filter and tulle. The CPW was applied at an average flow rate of 0.020 m(3) d(-1), corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 12 days. Efficiencies of 69, 72, 30 and 72% were obtained for the removal of total nitrogen (N-T), total phosphorus (P-T), total potassium (K-T) and total phenolic compounds (F-T), respectively, in the aiCWc. Aeration resulted in improved efficiency of pollutant removal such as N, P and phenolic compounds. The cultivated plant species (L. multiflorum) influenced the removal efficiencies of total-N, total-P and total-K in the systems, however, the best results were obtained by means of combination of vegetation with artificial aeration. Artificial aeration does not totally compensate the absence of plants, suggesting that the role of plants goes beyond the addition of oxygen to the medium, permitting the development of a more active and diverse microbial community near the root zone.

Its ecosystem is threatened due to diminishing water supplies and increasing. salinity. An alternative source of water to support species conservation habitat may be obtained from local rivers (e.g., Alamo or New Rivers), provided that a wetland treatment system can be developed to remove selenium (Se), fertilizer nutrients, and other contaminants. Here, we used mesocosms to evaluate a number of potential design options (e.g., plant species selection, sediment composition and arrangement, forced aeration, organic amendments, etc.) to improve the efficiency of Se removal using treatment wetlands. Our results show that, of five different substrate arrangements tested for Se removal, the most efficient was obtained for cattails growing in a substrate of cattail litter overlying sand and peat moss sediment (water column Se was reduced from 15 mu g Se/L to <0.1 mu g Se/L in 72 h). The addition of organic amendments in the form of alfalfa hay or alfalfa meal was also helpful in lowering Se levels. These results suggest that it may be possible to design constructed wetland water treatment systems capable of reducing Se concentrations in river water to values below 1 mu g Se/L.

The system covered a total area of 7,610 m(2). From 2 July 2007 to 7 August 2008, the treatment capacity was 2,076 m(3)day(-1) with an aeration quantity of 7,400 m(3) day(-1). The system effectively reduced the average annual output of BOD5 (52.0 %), NH4-N (58.41 %), and TP (41.61 %), although the percentage reductions of other pollutants, including chemical oxygen demand (34.1 %), suspended solid (38.9 %), and TN (31.05 %) were lower. The purpose of the HCW was for denitrification of the effluent from the AVCW, and annual average of 34.27 % of NO3-N was removed compared with the reading at the AVCW outlet. With hydraulic loading increased to 4,152 m3day-1 from 9 September to 23 November 2007, the removal rate for NO3-N from the HCW decreased substantially from 48.80 to 18.86 %. The total removal rates of NH4-N showed significant positive correlation with DO content in the AVCW and with total TN removal rates for the combined system (P<0.05). The study indicated that, even with limited artificial aeration, nitrification was very effective for NH4-N removal.

The results indicated that pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were increased in the wetland due to the algal growth. The highest total suspended solids (TSS) concentration was observed in the aeration pond due to the resuspension of solids, decreased in the wetland. The respective decreases in total nitrogen (TN) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were 15.9% and 28.7% on passing through the wetland. The nitrate and ammonia were increased by 45.4% and decreased by 79.9%, respectively. These variations provided strong evidence for the existence of nitrification. The total phosphorus (TP) and phosphate had respective reductions of 52.3% and 58.2% over the wetland. The total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) were also decreased. Generally, the TN, TP and phosphate removal efficiencies were positive. These positive removal efficiencies were mainly due to microbial activities, uptake by plants, and chemical precipitation at high pH. Negative removal efficiencies can be caused by continuous rainfall activities, with short antecedent dry days (ADDs) and unstable hydraulic conditions, some other biogeochemical transformations and algal growth also being important parameters.

In this study, a simplified pilot-scale rural wastewater treatment system has been proposed. The system consisted of an anaerobic digestion tank (for organic substances pretreatment), an aerobic five-cell submerged biofilm reactor (for organic substances degradation), and a constructed wetland (CW; for nutrients removal and effluent quality control) in sequence. A five-step water-dropping aeration technique was incorporated in the biofilm reactor for oxygen replenishment with one pump, the only equipment applied in the system that involved in water elevation and effectively alleviated the oxygen stress in the CW for nutrient removal improvement. Effects of economic vegetation species (water spinach vs. water bamboo), packing media (coal cinder vs. gravel), and flow patterns (submerged horizontal flow vs. vertical flow) on CW performance were examined under continuous influent loading. Distributions of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (generally accumulated in the top [<= 20 cm] front part of the CW), and denitrifying bacteria (mainly in the deeper part [> 20 cm] of the CW) were explored for total nitrogen (TN) removal. The optimized system achieved 68.9%+/- 15.8%, 68.6%+/- 15.1%, 69.5%+/- 14.6%, and 86.3%+/- 12.2% of chemical oxygen demand, NH4+-N, TN, and total phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies, respectively, during a 6-month operation with the effluent meeting the Chinese sewage discharge standard and were indicated to be of low cost, operation-friendly, and applicable for sewage treatment in Chinese rural communities.

In this study, two laboratory-scale recirculated up-flow constructed wetland (UFCW) reactors planted with Phragmites australis were constructed to investigate the treatment performance between aerated and non-aerated reactors for treating 50mg/L Reactive Black 5 (RB5)-containing wastewater. Results showed that the non-aerated reactor demonstrated an almost entire anaerobic environment yielded a better RB5 removal efficiency (89%) compared to the aerated reactor (81%). However, the aerated reactor performed higher removal on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and aromatic amines than the non-aerated reactor. Proper design ratio of anaerobic/aerobic region in UFCW is a key to accomplish not only color reduction but also COD and aromatic amines in textile wastewater treatment.

The results showed that ammonia removal rates reached higher values (172 g N/m(3) d to 564 g N/m(3) d) for C/N =2 and lower values (13.6 g N/m(3) d to 34.6 g N/m(3) d) for C/N =20. Between 50% and 70% of the ammonia was removed in the upper section of the BAF, where the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was over 2.1 g O-2/m(3) and the biofilm depth ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 mm. At the bottom section of the reactor, simultaneous removal of ammonia and nitrate was observed at the DO concentrations in the range 0.4 g O-2/m(3) to 0.8 g O-2/m(3). There was no removal of ammonia nitrogen for loads below 15 g N/m(3).d. The results indicate that the removal of nitrogen in partially aerated BAF may not only be explained by the conventional mechanisms of nitrification/denitrification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to determine the efficiencies of Ghasreshirin (constructed wetland), Islamabadgharb and Gilangharb wastewater treatment plants (stabilization ponds), Sarpolezahab and Paveh (extended aeration activated sludge) and Kermanshah (conventional activated sludge) in the removal of protozoan cysts and parasitic eggs. This study was carried out during six months and samples were collected at weekly intervals from influent and effluent of the wastewater plants. In order to determine the concentration of ova, 288 samples were analyzed by Mc Master Slide according to Bailenger method. No parasite eggs or protozoan cysts were detected in the effluents of the constructed wetland or stabilization ponds systems. The extended aeration activated sludge system of Sarpolezahab removed 99-100% of parasite eggs and >= 99% of protozoan cysts. The respective values for extended aeration activated sludge system of Paveh were 97.5-100% and >= 99%. However, the conventional activated sludge of Kermanshah removed 97-99% and 99-100% of parasite eggs and protozoan cysts, respectively. According to the results, removal efficiency for cysts and parasite eggs in natural systems (constructed wetland and stabilization ponds) is better than mechanical systems (extended aeration activated sludge and conventional activated sludge). The effluent quality of all systems in terms of nematode eggs is consisted to Engelberg index (nematode eggs count: 1 >= counts per liter). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this respect, we should consider the opportunities to reduce carbon footprint for small and large wastewater treatment plants. The use of anaerobic rather than aerobic treatment processes would achieve this aim because no aeration is required and the generation of methane can be used within the plant. High-rate anaerobic digesters receive great interests due to their high loading capacity and low sludge production. Among them, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors have been most widely used. However, there are still unresolved issues inhibiting the widespread of this technology in developing countries or countries with climate temperature fluctuations (such as subtropical regions). A large number of studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance of UASB reactors but there is a lack of updated documentation. In face of the existing limitations and the increasing importance of this technology, the authors present an up-to-date review on the performance enhancements of UASB reactors over the last decade. The important aspects of this article are: (i) enhancing the start-up and granulation in UASB reactors, (ii) coupling with post-treatment unit to overcome the temperature constraint, and (iii) improving the removal efficiencies of the organic matter, nutrients and pathogens in the final effluent. Finally the authors have highlighted future research direction based on their critical analysis. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simulation of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur conversion in batch-operated experimental wetland mesocosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Batch-operated wetland mesocosms; CWM1; Mechanistic model; Oxygen transfer rate	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; SULFATE REDUCTION; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; OXYGEN RELEASE; REMOVAL; MODEL; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN	A simulation model based on Constructed Wetland Model No. 1 (CWM1) using the AQUASIM mixed reactor compartment as a platform was built to study the dynamics of key processes governing COD and nutrient removal in wetland systems. Data from 16 subsurface-flow wetland mesocosms operated under controlled greenhouse conditions with three different plant species (Typha latifolia, Carex rostrata, Schoenoplectus acutus) and an unplanted control were used for calibration and validation in this mechanistic model. Mathematical equations for plant related processes (growth, physical degradation, decay, and oxygen leaching), physical re-aeration, as well as adsorption and desorption processes for COD and ammonium were included and implemented alongside CWM1 in the AQUASIM software, while some CWM1 parameters were adjusted to better fit the model predictions to experimental data during calibration. The simulation results showed that the model was able to describe the general trend of COD (R-2 = 0.97-0.99), ammonium (R-2 = 0.85-0.97) and sulphate (R-2 = 0.71-0.93) removal in the wetland mesocosms and also in their controls (unplanted) through the experimental temperature range of 12-24 degrees C. Oxygen transfer by physical re-aeration was found to be 0.05 and 0.09 g m(-2) d(-1) at 12 degrees C and 24 degrees C, respectively. The amount of root oxygen transfer was the highest for the planted mesocosms at 12 degrees C at rates of 1.91, 0.94, and 0.45 gm(-2) d(-1) in the Carex, Schoenoplectus and Typha mesocosms, respectively, indicating that COD of the bulk wastewater was removed mainly by anaerobic processes under the specific experimental situations. Measured COD removal was better in the planted mesocosms than in the control: differences were effectively modelled by varying the bacteria concentration. The sorption process was found to be important in simulating COD and ammonia removal under these experimental conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Rousseau, Diederik P.

Comprehensive analysis of step-feeding strategy to enhance biological nitrogen removal in alum sludge-based tidal flow constructed wetlands	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Alum sludge; Partial nitrification; Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND); Step-feeding; Tidal flow constructed wetlands	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; REED BED SYSTEM; SIMULTANEOUS NITRIFICATION; MAIN SUBSTRATE; LAB-SCALE; PERFORMANCE; DENITRIFICATION; OPERATION; DESIGN	Step-feeding strategies have been extensively studied and comprehensively analyzed in this study for a four-stage alum sludge-based tidal flow constructed wetlands (AIS-TFCWs) system. Enhanced total nitrogen removal of 83% is achieved under high nitrogen loading rate of 19.1 g N/m(2)d. The key issues towards the success of a significant nitrogen removal in step-feeding TFCWs are the bed resting time (which provides better aeration for nitrification) and up flow stage/delayed input of side stream(s) (which ensure favorable environment for better denitrification). Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) was found effective in the 1st stage of the system and SND via nitrite is the main nitrogen conversion mechanism. The optimal influent distribution fraction for step-feeding purpose can be estimated from a theoretical basis, which is a function of the influent BCOD/TKN ratio. Therefore the influent distribution fraction should be adjusted according to the variety of influent characteristics, rather than a fixed value. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Hu, Y.

The beds included a cobbles lower layer, where perforated PVC aeration tubes were placed, and two gravel layers on top. The setup included planted beds with common reeds and control units. Three sludge loading rates (SLR) were examined: 30, 60 and 75 kg dm/m(2)/yr. Heavy metal (HM) accumulation in the residual sludge layer was negligible or low, and was found to increase with sludge layer depth. Plant uptake was low; the belowground biomass accumulated significantly more HMs compared to the aboveground biomass. Less than 16% of the influent HM left the bed through drainage. HM accumulation in the gravel layer was the major metal sink in the mass balance. On the whole, the HM content of the residual sludge was below the legal limits proposed by the EU for land application. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

High Rate Nitrogen Removal in an Alum Sludge-Based Intermittent Aeration Constructed Wetland	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; AEROBIC GRANULAR SLUDGE; SIMULTANEOUS NITRIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR; LANDFILL LEACHATE; BIOFILM REACTOR; DENITRIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEM	A new development on treatment wetland technology for the purpose of achieving high rate nitrogen removal from high strength wastewater has been made in this study. The laboratory scale alum sludge-based intermittent aeration constructed wetland (AlS-IACW) was integrated with predenitrification, intermittent aeration, and step-feeding strategies. Results obtained from 280 days of operation have demonstrated extraordinary nitrogen removal performance with mean total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 90% under high N loading rate (NLR) of 46.7 g N m(-2) d(-1). This performance was a substantial improvement compared to the reported TN removal performance in literature. Most significantly, partial nitrification and simultaneous nitrification denitrification (SND) via nitrite was found to be the main nitrogen conversion pathways in the AlS-IACW system under high dissolved oxygen concentrations (3-6 mg L-1) without specific control. SND under high dissolved oxygen (DO) brings high nitrogen conversion rates. Partial nitrification and SND via nitrite can significantly reduce the demand for organic carbon compared with full nitrification and denitrification via nitrate (up to 40%). Overall, these mechanisms allow the system to maintaining efficient and high rate TN removal even under carbon limiting conditions.	[Hu, Yuansheng; Zhao, Yaqian; Zhao, Xiaohong; Kumar, Jeyakumar L.

We evaluated the effects of different substrates (sand mixed with I, 3, 5 or 7% of cinder, diatomite, active carbon or fly ash) on nutrient removal or poultry wastewater capacities. The set up consisted of coarse concrete sand (1.0-2.0 mm) mixed with one or the tested reactive media. The best removal efficiency was obtained using a 7% weight ratio of cinder mixed with sand, where a removal efficiency of 93.6% and 96.9%, respectively, for chemical and biochemical oxygen demand (COD, BODO5), and of 70.1% and 99.7%, respectively, for total and ammonia nitrogen (TN. NH4+-N), and 96.8% for total phosphorus (TP), were observed. In a second phase, bioaugmentation techniques, including aeration, microorganism inoculation and plant growing, were tested to increase nutrient removal in a system using a sand substrate mixed with cinder at a weight ratio of 7%. The increase or performance was observed for 4% of TP, and 11% of TN by artificial aeration, inoculation of bacteria and plant growth.

Experiments were carried out in subsurface flow CWs in Singapore to evaluate the fate and transport of eight pharmaceutical compounds. The CW system included three parallel horizontal subsurface flow CWs and three parallel unplanted beds fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The findings of the tests at 2-6 d HRTs showed that the pharmaceuticals could be categorized as (i) efficiently removed compounds with removal higher than 85% (ketoprofen and salicylic acid); (ii) moderately removed compounds with removal efficiencies between 50% and 85% (naproxen, ibuprofen and caffeine); and (iii) poorly removed compounds with efficiency rate lower than 50% (carbamazepine, diclofenac, and clofibric acid). Except for carbamazepine and salicylic acid, removal efficiencies of the selected pharmaceuticals showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement in planted beds as compared to the unplanted beds. Removal of caffeine, ketoprofen and clofibric acid were found to follow first order decay kinetics with decay constants higher in the planted beds than the unplanted beds. Correlations between pharmaceutical removal efficiencies and log K-ow were not significant (p > 0.05), implying that their removal is not well related to the compound's hydrophobicity.

The quantitative role of the higher aquatic plants in nutrient removal in these two operational modes was also investigated. Results indicated no significant difference (p > 0.05) in COD removal between batch and continuous flow modes for either the planted or unplanted treatments. Furthermore, the batch-loaded planted wetlands showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher ammonium removal efficiencies (95.2%) compared with the continuously fed systems (80.4%), most probably because the drain and fill batch mode presented systematically more oxidized environmental conditions. With respect to TP removal, for both planted and unplanted beds, there was significant enhancement (p < 0.05) in batch flow operation (69.6% for planted beds; 39.1% for unplanted beds) as compared to continuous flow operation (46.8% for planted beds; 25.5% for unplanted beds). In addition, at a 4-day hydraulic retention time (HRT), the presence of plants significantly enhanced both ammonia oxidation and TP removal in both batch and continuous modes of operation as compared to that for unplanted beds. An estimation of the quantitative role of aeration from drain and fill operation at a 4-day HRT, as compared to rhizosphere aeration by the higher aquatic plant, indicated that drain and fill operation might account for only less than half of the higher aquatic plant's quantitative contribution of oxygen (1.55 g O-2 per m(2) per day for batch flow versus 1.13 g O-2 per m(2) per day for continuous flow).

Although various processing technologies have been utilized for treatment of landfill leachate, their application to the landfills in rural areas is restricted by the availability of skilled professionals and high operation costs. In this experiment, four MSLs with altered soil mixed block (SMB) and different hydraulic load rate (HLR) were applied in the experiment to investigate the treatment of the landfill leachate without aeration or under low aeration supply. The experiment results showed that the improved MSL could effectively treat the chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4-N and P. COD and NH4-N removal efficiencies of MSL were 97.4%, 82.4% and 72.0%, 62.0%, respectively under HLRs of 200 and 400 L/(m(2).d) without aeration; COD and NH4-N removal efficiencies of M800 and M1600 were 62.3%, 53.4% and 45.3%, 35.3% respectively under intermittent aeration. N removal efficiency was low due to a strong nitrification effect, and the nitrogen removal capacity of the MSL was greatly reduced at the end of the experiment. P removal efficiency of MSL was 75.6 to 91.9% under HLR 200 and 400 L/(m(2).d). The intermittent aeration was helpful to remove the clogging of MSLs, after they were clogged under HLRs of 800 and 1600 L/(m(2).d). MSL is promising as an appealing nitrifying biofilm reactor.

The wetland units were planted with two plant species (i.e., common reeds and cattails), had different porous media material composition (i.e., carbonate, igneous, zeolite and bauxite) and three different total substrate thicknesses and gradations. Three loading/resting schedules were used. Water quality samples were collected at the inlet and the outlet of each unit. and were analyzed in the laboratory for the determination of various pollutants. The VFCW units were quite efficient in organic matter (BOD5 and COD) and nitrogen (TKN and NH4+-N) removal, with mean removal efficiencies exceeding 78% and 58%, respectively. Mean phosphorus (TP and OP) removal was lower (37%). The units were found to provide significant pollutant removal under high organic loads, up to 200 gCOD/m(2) d. The presence of reeds and aeration tubes was found to improve the performance, while plant species did not affect efficiency. The use of special materials, aiming at enhancing the adsorption of different constituents, did not improve the wetland efficiency, probably due to limited contact time between material and wastewater, and is not recommended.

Nutrients including nitrogen and phosphorus accumulated in the bank cultivated land were greater than those contained within the river estuary sediment as well as in the reservoir bay sediment. This implies that high concentrations of loosely exchangeable phosphorus (166.53 mg/kg) in cultivated land could, after the completion of the dam heightening project, easily lead to the development of algal blooms. Serious water and soil loss occurring in the reservoir area will promote the transportation of non-point source pollution mainly caused by untreated agricultural domestic wastewater, chemical fertilizer and livestock farming, which accounted for more than 50% of the total basin's nutrient input loads. Ecological control techniques were therefore the first choice for nutrient reduction and water quality guarantee in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. In order to guide the ecological restoration process, leading international ecological methodologies were summarized and compared, taking into consideration aspects of engineering, as well as ecological, biological, environmental and economic advantages and disadvantages. Finally, novel ecological filtration and a purification dam were designed for eutrophication control.

However, conventional constructed wetlands face problems with low pollutant removal efficiency and limited oxygen transfer capability. Therefore, a novel vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) system with drop aeration was developed in this study. Two pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands of 0.75 m(2) each were constructed with the same dimensions and configuration but different media, one of which (named as CW(1)) was filled with a 1:1 mixture (by weight) of zeolite and dolomite and the other (named as CW(2)) with the same zeolite only. The oxygen transfer capability of a multilevel two-layer drop aeration device, organics and nitrogen removal of CW(1) and CW(2), and pollutant distribution along the depths of CW(1) and CW(2) in different operational phases were studied. The results demonstrated that compared with the direct drop aeration process, the multilevel, two-layer drop aeration device supplied 2-6 mg/L higher dissolved oxygen per meter of drop height, and after installation of the six-level, two-layer drop aeration devices, the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand removal load was improved from 8.1 to 14.2 g m(-2) day(-1) for CW(1). With regard to the different filter media, nitrogen removal was improved by the adsorption of zeolite in the first year, with 5-36% higher NH (4) (+) -N removal efficiency of CW(2) compared with that in CW(1). Since it did not have a significant positive effect on phosphate removal, dolomite can be replaced by zeolite. The chemical oxygen demand removal mainly took place in the upper 15-cm filter layer in different operational phases, while nitrogen distribution along the depths of the VFCWs was different in different operational phases. In addition, as no operational problems occurred, the vertical flow constructed wetland system with drop aeration is an appropriate alternative for rural wastewater treatment, with numerous advantages of low capital and operation costs, no energy consumption, easy maintenance, high hydraulic loading rate, high pollutant removal efficiency, and no clogging.

The removal of dissolved organic carbon was obtained to be around 65-87% with specific removal load of 1.40-2.63 g/m(2) d. 94% of nitrate removal (under inflow concentration of 15 mg/L) irrespective of organic carbon loads indicated a highly active denitrification process in wetlands. Sulphate reduction was performed at a high level of 83% in a low redox potential (about -300 mV) under condition of inflow organic carbon concentration of 50 mg/L. The dosage of nitrate in the inflow can strongly hinder the process ofdissimilatory microbial sulphate. The coexist of sulphide with concentration of 1.65-2.65 mg/L and elemental sulphur of 0.17-2.18 mg/L in the pore water of wetlands demonstrated a simultaneous occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction and sulphide oxidation. A lower ammonium oxidation removal was initiated, which was probably caused by the toxic effect of sulphide with concentration of about 3 mg/L in the pore water. The sulphide concentration in the pore water was highly exponentially correlated with the redox potential, indicating the control of sulphide in wetlands could be performed by the adjustment of redox potential via aeration and/or nitrate dosage.

Materials and methods: The HSFW, equipped with cascaded natural aeration ditches (NADs), was the second stage of a hybrid constructed wetland (CW) after vertical-baffled flow wetland beds. The performances of the HSFW for organics and nitrogen removal in a full-scale hybrid CW system treating municipal wastewater for more than three years have been analysed. The spatial distributions of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), DO, microbial population density and specific oxygen uptake rate were determined, and their correlations were analysed in one selected section of the HSFW bed. Results: A 7-m-long shallow NAD increased the DO concentration from 0.28 mg O-2 l(-1) to 3.80 mg O-2 l(-1) and the ORP from +37.3 mV to +247.7 mV, creating an aerobic zone with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.5 h and an anoxic zone of another 0.5 h in series in the subsequent wetland bed. For the whole HSFW with three NADs, the macro aerobic and anoxic environment with a total HRT of 3 h can be created. Conclusions: The unique DO distribution in HSFW may contribute to an optimum environment for partial nitrification and anammox, and obtain a high performance for nitrogen removal. Correlation analysis showed that the microbial activity in the HSFW relied obviously on the redox condition.

The effects of planting density on nitrogen and phosphorus removal and on plant physiology in various seasons were analyzed. The results indicated that an increase in planting density improved the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from polluted water. When planting density increased from 10 to 20 plants per tank, the rates of nitrogen and phosphorus removal increased slowly, but some decline in individual plants was observed. The removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from polluted water correlated with seasonal variations in plant physiology, being most significant in autumn. There were 20 tillers in each plant with 10 plants per tank, compared to 11 tillers per plant with 20 plants per tank. The nitrogen and phosphorus contents of the plants for 5-10 plants per tank was 5.2 and 0.52 g kg(-1), compared to 1.2 and 0.13 g kg(-1) for 10-20 plants per tank, respectively. It is important to choose a reasonable planting density that is based on seasonal variations in plant physiology for the ecological restoration of polluted water.

In a pilot-scale operation, a subsurface flow constructed wetland (CW) consisted of a primary settlement tank, a trickling filter for pretreatment and two serially assembled basins. The trickling filter was added to ensure sufficient aeration, increase purification of the wastewater and shorten the wastewater purification time. The estimated nominal flow was 0.7 m(3)/d. The experiments were conducted using the wastewater from the municipal sewage canal of the city of Zagreb, with utilization of three different flows: 0.72 (A), 1.44 (B) and 2.88 (C) m(3)/d. The efficiency of the purification process was monitored over a period of three years (TSS, BOD5, COD, NH4-N, NO2-N, PO4-P, dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH). The experimental results showed an increase in the removal efficiency with a doubling of the nominal flow from 0.7 to 1.44 m(3)/d, which could be related to the implementation of the trickling filter where high removal rates were achieved.

Results indicated that artificial aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in IA and CA, which significantly favored the removal of organic matter and NH4+-N. The DO grads caused by intermittent aeration formed aerobic and anoxic regions in IA and thus promoted the removal of total nitrogen (TN). Although the removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH4+-N and TN in the three VFCWs all decreased with an increase in HLR, artificial aeration enhanced the reactor resistance to the fluctuation of pollutant loadings. The maximal removal efficiencies of CODCr, NH4+-N and total phosphorus (TP) (i.e., 81%, 87% and 37%, respectively) were observed in CA at 19 cm/day HLR, while the maximal TN removal (i.e., 57%) was achieved in 1A. Although the improvement of artificial aeration on TP removal was limited, this study has demonstrated the feasibility of applying artificial aeration to VFCWs treating polluted river water, particularly at a high HLR.

All the beds included a cobbles bottom layer, where perforated PVC aeration tubes were placed. One bed did not contain aeration tubes. Two gravel layers were placed above the cobbles layer. The setup included planted beds with common reeds and control units. Three sludge loading rates were examined: 30.60 and 75 kg dm/m(2)/yr. The dewatering efficiency of the planted units exceeded 95% volume reduction. The final dry matter content varied between 50 and 64%, depending on the applied SLR. Mineralization of the residual sludge also took place. VS content of the planted units decreased up to 20%, while nutrient concentration was also reduced. The presence of reeds, aeration tubes and a fine-grained material improved the system efficiency, while the material composition did not have any effect on efficiency. Moreover, the units were able to treat sludge with high concentration of Cr. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CW 1 was equipped with aeration pipe without reeds. CW 2 and CW 3 were planted with reeds, but with and.without the aeration pipe, respectively. The first two years.were sludge loading period and the CWs were fed during plant growth seasons. A new method of determination of PAHs in the CWs was developed by using ultrasonic extraction with GC/MS. The ultrasonic time, ratios of extraction solvent, and total amount of extraction solvent were studied experimentally. The orthogonal test conditions for the ultrasonic extracting with GC/MS method were optimized. The results showed that PAHs removal froni the residual sludge in planted CWs 2 and 3 was more effectively than that in unplanted CW 1, corresponding with 24.5%, 12.7% and 2.41% of removed PAHs, respectively.

J	Dickopp, J; Kazda, M; Cizkova, H				Dickopp, Jan; Kazda, Marian; Cizkova, Hana			Differences in rhizome aeration of Phragmites australis in a constructed wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Oxygen demand; ROL; Organic matter; Eutrophication	RADIAL OXYGEN LOSS; CONVECTIVE GAS-FLOW; TRIN EX STEUD; INTERNAL AERATION; FLOODING STRESS; GROWTH; ROOTS; TOLERANCE; ACID; SOIL	Waterlogged soils are a challenging environment for plants due to anoxic conditions and enrichment of phytotoxic substances in the rhizosphere. High contents of organic matter in the substrate as present in constructed wetlands (CW) may amplify these effects. The influence of substrate organic matter on the rhizome aeration of Phragmites australis (common reed) was investigated in a CW for sewage treatment on two sites with different organic concentrations: (a) inflow part of the bed with a high organic charge (high-organic site) and (b) outflow zone of the bed with a lower organic charge (low-organic site). Several diurnal oxygen (O(2)) courses were recorded inside the rhizomes using micro-optodes. Maximum O(2) percentages in the rhizomes were generally the same at both sites, but minimum O(2) values were lower in the low-organic site than in the high-organic site, leading to higher amplitudes at the low-organic site. The results suggest that oxygen release from the roots is hampered under high-organic compared to low-organic conditions. This observation might be explained by changes in gas conductivity of the roots, but also by alterations in microbial oxygen demand, under different organic burden. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The main objective of the study was to test the contribution of artificial aeration, recirculation ratio and mass concentration of steel slag on pollutant removal in winter when the plants arc dormant. It had been shown that SBEP and BAF play different roles in removing contaminants from wastewater. During the airflow experiment, the removal efficiency of COD and TP in SBEP was higher than that in BAF, whereas BAF can compensate for the deficiency of SBEP where no significant improvement on ammonium nitrogen removal is observed. Yet, the removal efficiencies of COD, TP and NH(4)(+)-N in SBEP could be improved apparently when different recirculation ratio or various mass concentration of steel were applied. Especially, when the airflow of 0.06 L.h(-1), the recirculation ratio rate of 80% and the mass concentration of steel of 2.2-2.4 g.L(-1) were applied, the highest efficiency of 94.6%, 77.9% and 80.7% for COD, TP and NH(4)(+)-N were achieved, respectively. The integrated treatment system of SBEP and BAF was proved to be an effective wastewater treatment technique and a better alternative to treat domestic sewage.

Effects of livestock wastewater variety and disinfectants on the performance of constructed wetlands in organic matters and nitrogen removal	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Biodegradability; Constructed wetlands; Disinfectant; Livestock wastewater; Nitrogen	REED BED SYSTEM; OF-THE-ART; ALUM SLUDGE; MANAGEMENT; DAIRY	Background, aim and scope Treatment performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) is largely dependent on the characteristics of the wastewater. Although livestock wastewater is readily biodegradable in general, its variety in biodegradability can still be significant in practice. In addition, it is a common practice to periodically use disinfectants in livestock activities for health concerns. Obviously, the residual of the disinfectants in livestock wastewater may have serious inhibitory effect on the microbial activities during wastewater treatment. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the variety of livestock wastewater in biodegradability and its effect on the performance of a pilot scale tidal flow CWs (TFCWs) in organic matter and nitrogen removal. Furthermore, investigation of the potential inhibition of the chosen disinfectants on organic matter biodegradation and nitrification was another aim of this study. Materials and methods The TFCWs system consisted of four-stage downflow reed beds with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.29 m(3)/m(2)center dot per day. Long-term stored livestock wastewater and fresh livestock wastewater were used, respectively, as feed to the system in different periods. Meanwhile, batch aeration tests were carried out to investigate the difference in biodegradation of the two types of wastewaters. Inhibitions of two types of disinfectants, namely UNIPRED and HYPROCLOR ED, on microbial activities were investigated in laboratory batch tests, with dosage of from 0.05% to 0.5%. Results With fresh livestock wastewater, removal efficiencies of up to 93% and 94% could be achieved with average of 73% and 64% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and TN, respectively. The performance deteriorated when the system was fed with long-term stored wastewater. In the batch tests, the long-time stored wastewater was characterized as non-biodegradable or at least very slowly biodegradable, while the fresh wastewater was readily biodegradable. UNIPRED showed very strong inhibition on both heterotrophic organisms and nitrifiers. Tested inhibition started from content of 0.05%, which is 1/10 of the recommended usage rate. Inhibitory effect of HYPROCLOR ED on COD degradation started from 0.1% and complete inhibition occurred from content of 0.3%, while significant inhibition on nitrification started from 0.1%. Conclusions Livestock wastewater could vary significantly in biodegradability and it may turn to be non-biodegradable after a long-term storage. The variety of the livestock wastewater has a decisive influence on the performance of the CWs system, especially in TN elimination. In addition, the application of disinfectants UNIPRED and HYPROCLOR ED may cause serious inhibition on microbial activities and subsequent system failure.	[Hu, Y. S.; Kumar, J. L. G.; Akintunde, A.

The removal rates are generally satisfactory in terms of COD, BOD(5), TP and SS removal; while nitrogen removal is deficient in most of the present operating SWIS due to the different requirements for the presence of oxygen for nitrification and denitrification processes. To study the enhanced nitrogen removal technologies, two pilot subsurface wastewater infiltration systems were constructed in a village in Shenyang, China. The filled matrix was a mixture of 5% activated sludge, 65% brown soil and 30% coal slag in volume ratio for both systems. Intermittent operation mode was applied in to supply sufficient oxygen to accomplish the nitrification; meanwhile sewage was supplemented as the carbon source to the lower part in to denitrify. The constructed subsurface wastewater infiltration systems worked successfully under wetting-drying ratio of 1:1 with hydraulic loading of 0.081 m(3)/(m(2) d) for over 4 months. Carbon source was supplemented with shunt ratio of 1:1 and shunt position at the depth of 0.5 m. The experimental results showed that intermittent operation mode and carbon source supplementation could significantly enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency with little influence on COD and TP removal. The average removal efficiencies for NH(3)-N and TN were 87.7 +/- 1.4 and 70.1 +/- 1.0%, increased by 12.5 +/- 1.0 and 8.6 +/- 0.7%, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, DQ; Tan, SK; Gersberg, RM; Sadreddini, S; Zhu, JF; Nguyen, AT				Zhang, Dong Qing; Tan, Soon Keat; Gersberg, Richard M.; Sadreddini, Sara; Zhu, Junfei; Nguyen Anh Tuan			Removal of pharmaceutical compounds in tropical constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Pharmaceutical; Removal; Tropical region	PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS; HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE FLOW; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS; MUSK FRAGRANCES; SCALE; ENVIRONMENT; BEHAVIOR; PPCPS; WASTEWATERS	The ability of tropical horizontal subsurface constructed wetlands (HSSF CWs) planted with Typha angustifolia to remove four widely used pharmaceutical compounds (carbamazepine, declofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) at the relatively short hydraulic residence time of 2-4 days was documented. For both ibuprofen and naproxen, pharmaceutical compounds with low D(ow) values, the planted beds showed significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of removal efficiencies (80% and 91%, respectively, at the 4 day HRT), compared to unplanted beds (60% and 52%, respectively). The presence of plants resulted in the removal of these pharmaceutical compounds from artificial wastewater. The more oxidizing environment in the rhizosphere might have played an important role, but other rhizosphere effects, beside rhizosphere aeration, appeared to be important also. Carbamazepine, considered one of the most recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, and declofenac showed low removal efficiencies in our CW, and this is attributable to their higher hydrophobicity. The fact that the removal of these compounds could be explained by the sorption onto the available organic surfaces, explains why there was no significant difference (p > 0.05)in their removal efficiencies between planted as compared to unplanted beds. No statistical significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed for the removal efficiencies of any of the pharmaceuticals tested for the 2-day HRT as compared to that corresponding to 4-day HRT. The rather efficient removal shown by the wetlands in this study (with HRTs of 2-4 days), indicates that such a CW system may be more practically used (with less land requirements) in tropical regions for removing conventional pollutants and certain pharmaceutical compounds from wastewater effluents.

Life cycle assessment of vertical and horizontal flow constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment considering nitrogen and carbon greenhouse gas emissions	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon dioxide; Constructed wetlands; Life cycle assessment; Methane; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrous oxide; Vertical flow; Wastewater treatment	TREATMENT-PLANT; TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES; INTERMITTENT AERATION; ACTIVATED-SLUDGE; TREATMENT SYSTEM; OXIDE EMISSIONS; N2O EMISSIONS; REMOVAL; SCALE; PARADIGM	Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to compare the environmental impacts of vertical flow constructed wetlands (VFCW) and horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HFCW). The LCAs include greenhouse gas (N(2)O, CO(2) and CH(4)) emissions. Baseline constructed wetland designs are compared to different treatment performance scenarios and to conventional wastewater treatment at the materials acquisition, assembly and operation life stages. The LCAs suggest that constructed wetlands have less environmental impact, in terms of resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The VFCW is a less impactful configuration for removing total nitrogen from domestic wastewater. Both wetland designs have negligible impacts on respiratory organics, radiation and ozone. Gaseous emissions, often not included in wastewater LCAs because of lack of data or lack of agreement on impacts, have the largest impact on climate change. Nitrous oxide accounts for the increase in impact on respiratory inorganic, and the combined acidification/eutrophication category. The LCAs were used to assess the importance of nitrogen removal and recycling, and the potential for optimizing nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that aeration significantly influenced the morphological characteristics and physiological responses of P. cordata and water purification. The roots, stems and leaves of P. cordata grown under aeration conditions were shorter than those of plants grown under non-aeration conditions. The biomass and accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorous by P. cordata under aeration conditions were lower than those of plants grown under non-aeration conditions. Aeration resulted in the densities of the tillers and roots increasing. In addition, aeration led to increased activities of peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) and decreased contents of chlorophyll (Chla, Chlb) and soluble protein (SP). In the aeration purifying tanks, the average removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD(Cr)), total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)(+)-N) increased by 16.67%, 12.13% and 14.16%, respectively, during all three seasons, while the average removal efficiencies of total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) decreased by 10.47% and 9.74%, respectively.

The effects of intermittent artificial aeration and the use of polyhedron hollow polypropylene balls (PHPB) as part of the wetland substrate on the nutrient removal potential were also evaluated. During the entire running period, supplementary aeration enhanced the chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus first order mean removal constants by 0.28 m/d, 3.05 m/d, 0.92 m/d, 0.74 m/d and 0.60 m/d, respectively, but reduced the nitrate-nitrogen removal constant by 1.72 m/d in contrast to non-aerated wetlands. A significantly positive contribution of PHPB to nutrient removal was obtained. The combination of artificial aeration and PHPB resulted in the augmentation of the first order mean removal constants by 0.29 m/d, 3.12 m/d, 1.15 m/d, 0.65 m/d and 0.54 m/d for chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus, respectively. Findings from a brief cost-benefit analysis suggest that both artificial aeration and the presence of PHPB would result in enhanced nutrient removal that is cost efficient for future projects, particularly if electricity costs are low.

Surfactants were determined by extraction spectrophotometric methods. Anionic surfactants were removed from wastewater with the efficiency 81.7 %. The efficiency increased with increasing temperature of interstitial water and decreased with rising water inflow. Removal of anionic surfactants was influenced by aeration of the wetland bed via roots and rhizomes of vegetation. Oxygen introduced into the wetland accelerated removal of anionic surfactants. The removal of non-ionic surfactants under aerobic or anaerobic conditions was almost complete: its average efficiency was 98.1 %. Organics (expressed as chemical oxygen demand) were removed from treated water with the efficiency 86.4 %. Constructed wetlands can be used as suitable alternatives for treatment of wastewater from small villages. The wetlands are relatively simple and inexpensive. The used extraction spectrophotometric methods are sensitive, precise, and accurate enough for the purpose.

The quantity of organic matter in water can be determined as the biochemical oxygen demand in five days (BOD). BOD in village municipal sewage is around 250 mg l(-1) or 65 g per day from each resident. It means that 1.7 kg of oxygen is needed for mineralizing one kg of organic matter. Therefore, it can be concluded that high oxygen demand is required to mineralize organic matter using aerotanks. With a compressor and aeration discs or tubes the oxygen in the form of air is provided to aerotank. To reduce electricity consumption in wastewater treatment, we present to adapt natural conditions. Mineralization of organic matter in constructed wetlands performs basing on bacteria activity in presence of oxygen. The main difference is the method for oxygen supply. In constructed wetlands oxygen demand provides the plants growing above the filter material and it consumes no electricity. Constructed wetlands can be designed with different water flow in filter material horizontal flow wetlands, vertical flow wetlands and shallow ponds with plants.

Towards the development of a novel construction solid waste (CSW) based constructed wetland system for tertiary treatment of secondary sewage effluents	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Construction solid waste; constructed wetland; nutrient removal; reuse; tertiary treatment	DEWATERED ALUM SLUDGE; REMOVAL; TECHNOLOGY; SUBSTRATE	This study was conducted to examine the possibility of using construction solid waste (CSW), an inevitable by-product of the construction and demolition process, as the main substrate in a laboratory scale multi-stage constructed wetland system (CWs) to improve phosphorus (P) removal from secondary sewage effluent. A tidal-flow operation strategy was employed to enhance the wetland aeration. This will stimulate aerobic biological processes and benefit the organic pollutants decomposition and nitrification process for ammoniacal-nitrogen (NH+4-N) removal. The results showed that the average P concentration in the secondary sewage effluent was reduced from 1.90 mg-P/L to 0.04 mg-P/L. CSW presents excellent P removal performance. The average NH+4-N concentration was reduced from 9.94 mg-N/L to 1.0 mg-N/L through nitrification in the system. The concentration of resultant nitrite and nitrate in the effluent of the CSW based CWs ranged from 0.1 to 2.4 mg-N/L and 0.01 to 0.8 mg-N/L, respectively. The outcome of this study has shown that CSW can be successfully used to act as main substrate in CWs. The application of CSW based CWs on improving N and P removals from secondary sewage effluent presents a win-win scenario. Such the reuse of CSW will benefit both the CSW disposal and nutrient control from wastewater. More significantly, such the application can transfer the CSW from a 'waste' to 'useful' material and can ease the pressure of construction waste solid management. Meanwhile, the final effluent from the CSW-based CWs can be used as non-potable water source in landscape irrigation, agriculture and industrial process.

Separation of algae is inevitable to produce high effluent quality and to comply with local effluent standards. Algal growth control measures including emergent and floating macrophytes as well as back cloth physical light shading and algaecide application were studied and were aimed to reuse the effluent for water resource conservation and groundwater recharge. The results demonstrated that emergent and free-floating macrophytes light shading on algal growth control were viable in both batch experiments and field-scale hybrid natural water purification systems such as surface flow wetlands. Water quality parameters including COD, turbidity, SS were positively correlated with the algal concentrations and could be used as indictors of the trophic status of aquatic systems. Emergent macrophytes assisted control algal growth by preventing sunlight from reaching the water column in surface flow wetlands. Results of this study can be used by similar hybrid natural water purification systems to control algal activity and to prevent effluent deterioration.	[Yeh, T. Y.; Ke, T. Y.; Lin, Y.

Experimental study of a novel hybrid constructed wetland for water reuse and its application in Southern China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hybrid constructed wetland; low-cost sewage treatment; nutrient removal; water reuse	HORIZONTAL SUBSURFACE-FLOW; WASTE-WATER; LANDFILL LEACHATE; PERFORMANCE; EXPERIENCE; PLANT	A new type of hybrid constructed wetland (CW), consisting of both vertical-baffled flow wetland (VBFW) and horizontal subsurface flow wetland (HSFW), has been deployed in Southern China to naturally accelerate the removal of organic matter and nitrogen. The hybrid CW system is characterised by a combination of continuous baffled flow vertical wetland and 'S' pattern horizontal subsurface flow wetland with natural aeration ditches to increase the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the HSFW bed. An internal circulatory system from the HSFW effluent back to the VBFW may optionally be operated to enhance the biological denitrification effect. Cyperus alternifolius is the main macrophyte in the wetland bed. The performance of the hybrid CW was studied with a pilot-scale system and three full-scale systems for municipal sewage treatment in Southern China. The results suggest that this new hybrid CW can achieve removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus of better than 83.6, 95.0, 71.7, 64.5 and 68.1% respectively, with a specific wetland bed area of 0.70-0.93 m(2) PE(-1). The mean effluent concentrations of these parameters would meet the regulatory discharge limits for wastewater treatment systems (GB18918, 2002) and reuse in the context of agricultural irrigation solutions in China.

However, they rapidly become anoxic and consequently do not remove ammonium-nitrogen. Horizontal-flow aerated rock filters (HFARF), developed to permit nitrification and hence ammonium-N removal, were compared with a novel vertical-flow aerated rock filter (VFARF). There were no differences in the removals of BOD5, TSS and TKN, but the VFARF consistently produced effluents with lower ammonium-N concentrations (<0.3 mg N/L) than the HFARF (0.8-1.5 mg N/L) and higher nitrate-N concentrations (24-29 mg N/L vs. 17-24 mg N/L).

A promising approach of reject water treatment using a tidal flow constructed wetland system employing alum sludge as main substrate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						alum sludge; constructed wetland; nutrient control; reject water; reuse; wastewater treatment plant	TREATMENT RESIDUALS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; PILOT	This study examined a novel reuse of alum sludge, an inescapable by-product of drinking water treatment process when aluminium salt is added as a coagulant, as the main medium in a laboratory-scale multi-stage constructed wetland (CW) system for reject water treatment. Such reject water is a main concern in municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) for increasing the organic and nutrient loading. A 'tidal flow' strategy was employed to enhance the wetland aeration to stimulate organic matters (OM) and ammoniacal-nitrogen (N) oxidation while the 'step feed' operation was adopted to supply the necessary amount of carbon source for denitrification. The results reveal that alum sludge acting as P adsorbent can secure the P removal. Meanwhile, high removals of N and OM can also be obtained due to the active bacteria growth on the alum sludge surface. The results show that average removal efficiencies of 65.4 +/- 12.3% for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 67.8 +/- 9.2% for five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), 33.6 +/- 17.0% for N and 99.5 +/- 0.49% for P can be achieved over a period of 190 days. This indicates that novel reuse of alum sludge as medium in CW system can provide a promising approach for reject water treatment. Therefore, it will significantly reduce the amount of pollutant feedback through reject water recycling in a MWWTP.	[Yang, Y.; Guo, X. C.; Ren, Y. X.; Wang, L.; Wang, X.

The aerated wetland reactor outperformed the non-aerated one in the removal of organic matters, NH(4)-N and aromatic amines. The T-P removal efficiency for both wetland reactors was not much different throughout the study and the supplementary aeration showed no significant effect on T-P removal. As influent AO7 concentration increased from 50 to 100 mg/L, the performance in biodegradation of organic matters and nitrification in the non-aerated wetland reactor, and denitrification and decolorization in the aerated wetland reactor were affected. As HRT increased from 3 to 6 d, the removal of NH(4)-N and NO(3)-N in the aerated wetland reactor was not significantly different, but the NH(4)-N removal efficiency improved tremendously in the non-aerated wetland reactor.

An integrated treatment system for coffee processing wastewater using anaerobic and aerobic process	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Coffee processing wastewater; UAHR; Aeration; Constructed wetland system	CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; DIGESTION	The experiment was conducted to develop an integrated treatment system for coffee processing wastewater (CPWW) through the combination of biomethanation with aeration and wetland plants treatment. The biomethanation was carried out at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) using upflow anaerobic hybrid reactor (UAHR) and 18h of HRT was found to be optimum. The maximum biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solids (TS) reduction were 66.0%, 61.0% and 58.0%, respectively with organic loading rate of 9.55 kg m(-3) day(-1). The reduction of pollution load of the wastewater by microbial action augmented by aeration resulted in the reduction of electrical conductivity (EC), BUD, COD, and total solids (TS). Continuous aeration of wastewater resulted in maximum reduction of BUD (74.6%), COD (68.6%) and TS (49.3%). The wetland plant, Typha latifolia reduced 85.4% and 78.0% of BUD and COD, respectively in biomethanated cum aerated CPWW. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Microcosm wetlands planted with Phragmites australis were subjected to a 4-month experiment involving different operations (continuously and intermittently flood) and time ratios of flood to drain (F/D) with the hydraulic loading of 0.10 m(3)/m(2)/batch. It was found that the intermittent operation promoted a lower level of COD and TP removal. The intermittent operation caused more oxidizing conditions in the microcosm wetlands and thus greatly enhanced the removal of ammonium, and the removal efficiency was more than 90%. However, the intermittent operated wetlands had lower TN removal efficiencies the flooding system. With different lengths of drying time, the COD and TP removal were similar. The removal of ammonium was enhanced at a lower level with the prolongation of drying time. Contrarily, the TN removal was lower at F/D=1:2 (46.86%) than at F/D=2:1 (56.32%). The detected results of photosynthetic rate of Phragmites australis showed that the intermittent operation had no harmful effect on the wetland plant and the plant could grow normally.

The water produced by the stormwater harvesting system, which included a constructed wetland, was found to be near potable quality. Parameters exceeding the drinking water guidelines before recharge included small numbers of fecal indicator bacteria and elevated iron concentrations and associated color. This is the first reported study of a managed aquifer recharge (MAR) scheme to be assessed following the Australian guidelines for MAR. A comprehensive staged approach to assess the risks to human health and the environment of this project has been undertaken, with 12 hazards being assessed. A quantitative microbial risk assessment undertaken on the water recovered from the aquifer indicated that the residual risks posed by the pathogenic hazards were acceptable if further supplementary treatment was included. Residual risks from organic chemicals were also assessed to be low based on an intensive monitoring program. Elevated iron concentrations in the recovered water exceeded the potable water guidelines. Iron concentrations increased after underground storage but would be acceptable after postrecovery aeration treatment. Arsenic concentrations in the recovered water continuously met the guideline concentrations acceptable for potable water supplies. However, the elevated concentration of arsenic in native groundwater and its presence in aquifer minerals suggest that the continuing acceptable residual risk from arsenic requires further evaluation.

Aerobic and anaerobic regions were well developed at the upper and lower beds, respectively, in the UFCW reactors with supplementary aeration. The emergent plants employed were Phragmites australis and Manchurian wild rice. The COD, T-N, T-P, NH(4)-N and NO(3)-N removal efficiencies for the UFCW reactors were in the range of 90-94%, 69-92%, 29-52%, 59-98% and 45-100%, respectively. The organic matter and NH(4)-N removal efficiencies in the aerated wetland reactors were better than the non-aerated wetland reactors. The supplementary aeration has enhanced the aerobic biodegradation of organic matter and nitrification. The Manchurian wild rice outperformed P. australis in the removals of T-P, T-N and NH(4)-N.

A full-scale integrated treatment system was developed at Poisy in the French Alps. The treatment system consists of an aerated settling tank followed by vertical-flow reed beds planted with common reed. Recirculation of reed bed effluent to the settling tank was used to reduce the concentrations of pollutants within the system. Dairy farm effluents included dairy manure, milk house wash water, manure storage runoff and at times small amounts of waste milk. Mean inflow rate for milk house wastewater was 5,000 L d(-1) (+50 L of waste milk). During periods of heavy rainfall, inflow rates of up to 35,000 L d(-1) were observed due to runoff from yard areas. To improve treatment performance, an aeration system was installed in the settling tank in May 2006. Mass removals increased by more than 10% for organic pollutants due mainly to aeration. Mean load removals ranged from 82% to 96% for organic and solid pollutants. Mean total nitrogen and phosphorus removals were 76% and 19%, respectively. Sludge accumulation on the reed beds was 2.2 cm year(-1). Sludge quality conformed to French land application regulations.

Wetland treatment of leachate from a closed landfill	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Wetlands; Leachate; Treatment; Ammonia; Metals; Volatiles; Hydrocarbons	COAL-MINE DRAINAGE; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; PERFORMANCE; MICROCOSMS	A wetland system has operated seasonally at Saginaw Township, MI, USA, for ten years. The system consists of extraction, aeration, settling, intermittent vertical sand filtration, a surface flow wetland treatment with recycle, and discharge to the Tittibawassee River. The 0.85 ha cattail wetland treats the full leachate flow, with a total system detention time of 180 days. The high recycle rate creates a lesser wetland detention time of 60 days. Ammonia is the principal contaminant of concern, because it occurs at high concentrations, typically 300-500 mg/L. Ammonia mass reduction averaged 99.5% for the last nine years, with a 95% mass removal in the startup year. Metals were not present in all samples, with modest reductions in those always present (zinc 16%, arsenic 29%, barium 78%, chromium 67%). Volatile organic compounds were removed to below detection, excepting BTEX, which occurred in only 2% of the outflow samples. Base neutral organics, PCBs and pesticides were also removed to below detection, excepting phthalates with an outlet detection frequency of 29%. No pesticides or PCBs were detected in the system outflow. The ammonia removal rate coefficients for the wetland (12 m/yr) was at the 55th percentile of the distribution for other surface flow wetlands. The vertical filter was likely oxygen limited, and functioned with an apparent oxygen utilization of 30 gO/(m(2) d). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of Electric Arc Furnace Slag as a Potential Phosphate-Removal Substrate	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS; SOILS; ADSORPTION	A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of locally available electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) as a substrate for removing phosphorus from wastewater. First, in a laboratory study, EAFS was found to have high phosphorus removal efficiency for three P concentrations (0.3, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/L); this resulted in nearly 100% phosphorus removal in 24 h. Next, the experiment was repeated using aeration and similar phosphorus removal was observed but in a shorter contact time of 1 h. The adsorption capacity of EAFS was determined to be 1,458 mg/kg. In a pilot-scale study, over 90% P removal took place in the first 4 h under nonaerated conditions, and nearly 100% removal in 8 h. While the P removal with aeration was relatively less initially for the shorter residence times, a 100% removal was observed for the 24-h residence time.

The treatment plant consisted of aeration and sedimentation steps for pre-treatment, and a filter. The plant was designed to simultaneously remove various types of pollutants. The efficiencies of pre-treatment and of the main treatment step were investigated over a period of 3 years at the landfill site. By continuous aeration of the leachate the concentrations of Fe and Mn were reduced by 55% and 49%, respectively. By prolonged sedimentation suspended solid content was noticeably reduced (72%). in the filter, consisting of a mixture of peat and carbon-containing ash as a treatment medium, very high reduction of polar organic compounds, e.g. phenol (74%), o-and p-cresol (91%), and 2,4-dimethylphenol (73%), high average reduction of metals, e.g. Pb (78%), Fe (74%), Cu (73%), Mn (56%), Sn (55%), and Zn (47%), and good average reduction of DOC (26%), Tot-N (23%) and NH(4)-N (46%) were achieved. Sixty non-polar compounds in the leachate, identified by GC-MS screening, occurred at trace level. Most of them were considerably reduced in the filter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The types of the four units include aerated and planted CW (APCW), planted CW (PCW), aerated CW (ACW) and CW, and all the units have the identical dimensions of 3 m in length, 0.7 m in width and I m in depth. The automated aeration was activated when the oxygen concentrations in the units were lower than 0.2 mg/L and ceased when the oxygen concentrations in the CWs were higher than 0.6 mg/L More stable alkaline pH values were found in aeration units than that in the non-aeration units. APCW, in which the removal efficiencies of BOD, NH(4)(+)-N and TN were 94.4% (16.7 g BOD d(-1) m(-2)), 89.1% (4.54 g NH(4)(+)-N d(-1) m(-2)), and 86.0%( 4.99 g TN d(-1) m(-2)) respectively, was more effective at pollutant removal than the other three units. There were no significant differences in TP removal between the aeration units and non-aeration units. Less surface area is needed due to high removal efficiency in APCW and the additional cost of operation is quite little. The results from this experiment indicated that limited artificial aeration in constructed wetlands is a cost-effective method for treating domestic wastewater. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study showed that this system of biological and ecological combination was stable and good at improving the quality and efficiency of polishing wastewater. Six runs under different HRT combinations were carried out in order to obtain the better purification performance of the SMBR-IVCW system. The results indicated that the better HRT combination was 7.7 h for SMBR and 11.52 h for IVCW. In such condition, the concentrations of COD. ammonia and TP in the final effluent were 11.0. 0.086 and 0.44 mg L(-1), respectively, which reached the Class III of the national environmental quality standards for surface water in China. In fact, the HRT of the two units had great effect on the purification efficiency and investment cost. By regulating the ratio of HRT between these two units, the optimum operation conditions could be obtained to reach the double wins of high purification and low costs. In the SMBR-IVCW system, the SMBR unit acted as the secondary treatment, contributing to removing the organics and nitrification. While the IVCW unit was more like as the tertiary treatment, contributing to the denitrification and further dephosphorization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

KINETICS OF DAIRY WASTEWATER TREATMENT IN THE SBR SYSTEM	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION			English	Article						Industrial wastewaters; SBR system; dairy industry	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS	There are two kinds of wastewater that may originate at a dairy plant: post-production and non-production waste. Dairy wastewater treatment is a process consisting of several stages. In the pre-treatment stage, fat and sand is removed from wastewater. The second stage treatment consists mainly in aerobic treatment with activated sludge, advanced oxidation methods and an anaerobic treatment. In recent years, more and more plants have been treating their wastewater in SBR type reactors, because they are flexible at work and enable the user to change conditions to suit the variable quality of raw wastewater. The research on the kinetics of the wastewater treatment process in an SBR reactor has been conducted. The removal of several factors such as nitrogen compounds, TOC, phosphorus and the kinetics of oxygen concentration and redox potential have been analyzed. The experiment was carried out in two 12 dm(3) volume SBR reactors in a lab-scale. The SBR reactors were operated with a cycle time of 12 hours with three hours of filling, seven hours of aeration, an hour of sedimentation, half an hour of decantation and half an hour of technical break. In presented research average parameters of raw wastewater were: TOC 329 mg C/dm(3), ammonium nitrogen 11.15 mg N(NH4)/dm(3), and total phosphorus 15.42 mg P/dm(3).

Both SFs are designed on the same principle: a vertical subsurface flow filter followed by a horizontal subsurface flow filter. Six different operational regimes were tested during the experiments. With a decrease in wastewater and pollutant load and the larger re-circulation of wastewater, purification efficiency increased in terms of most water quality indicators. The highest purification efficiencies in the Noo SF, 99% and 82% for BOD(7) and N(tot) removal respectively, were achieved when the re-circulation rate of 300% was applied and in the Ramsi SF, 99% and 87% for BOD(7) and N(tot) removal respectively, were achieved, when the re-circulation rate of 300 to 600% was applied. In order to achieve effective organic matter removal. nitrification/denitrification and TSS removal, the re-circulation rate must be from 100 to 300% of the inflowing wastewater. The re-circulation of wastewater in overloaded systems is a good solution for the improvement of the aeration and overall purification efficiency of CWs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ROL of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) increased from 22.44 ng cm-2 min-1 in the control (just fresh water) to 31.09 ng cm-2 min-1 when received normal wastewater (NW) and to 44.22 ng cm-2 min-1 when treated with strong wastewater (10NW). However, discharge of both NW and 10NW caused 28% decreases of ROL in the root tip of Excoecaria agallocha L., and the decreases in Acanthus ilicifolius L. were even more significant, with 45% when treated by 10NW. The changes of ROL were related to the root anatomy. Among three species, A. ilicifolius had the highest proportional cross-sectional area of aerenchyma air spaces, suggesting that the internal oxygen transfer to root tip was the fastest. However, the area of aerenchyma air spaces in the root tip of 10NW treated A. ilicifolius was significantly reduced while area of epidermis and hypodermis (E+H) increased leading to less oxygen supply to root tip. Compared to B. gymnorrhiza and E. agallocha, the (E+H) layer of A. ilicifolius was the thinnest, and the cells without suberized walls were loosely packed in all three treatments. These results suggested that the root anatomy and ROL of B. gymnorrhiza was least affected by wastewater discharge, followed by E. agallocha, and A. ilicifolius was the most susceptible species thus was not suitable for treating strong wastewater.

The process gives benefits in terms of applicability across very small to large scale, natural aeration, absence of moving parts, no biological sludge generation, odor free green aesthetic ambience. RESULTS: Residence time distribution (RTD) studies were carried out using laboratory scale CSF. Pulse potassium bromide tracer tests were carried out to determine RTD, and the Peclet number found to be 9-13 for a 2 m bed, and 2-3 for a 0.30 m bed with oxygen transfer of 0.08 h(-1). CONCLUSION: The two-channel dispersion model for flow behavior shows a good fit to the experimental data, indicating a reactor Peclet number 9-13 for a 2 m bed and 2-3 for a 0.3 m bed. Oxygen transfer studies carried out using various methods gave an oxygen transfer coefficient of about 0.08 h(-1). Wastewater purification studies indicate overall COD removal rate of around 50 mg L(-1) h(-1), suggesting that highly aerobic conditions are prevalent in the CSF system.

Oxygen transfer in marsh-pond-marsh constructed wetlands treating swine wastewater	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Swine wastewater; ammonia emission; oxygen balance; constructed wetlands		Oxygen transfer efficiencies of various components of the marsh-pond-marsh (M-P-M) and marsh-floating bed-marsh (M-FB-M) wetlands treating swine wastewater were determined by performing oxygen mass balance around the wetlands. Biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total nitrogen (TN) loading and escaping rates from each wetland were used to calculate carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxygen demands. Ammonia emissions were measured using a wind tunnel. Oxygen transfer efficiencies of the aerated ponds were estimated by conducting the ASCE standard oxygen transfer test in a tank using the same aeration device. Covering pond water surface with the floating bed slightly decreased oxygen transfer efficiency. The diffused membrane aeration (26.7 kg O2 ha-1 d-1) of M-P-M was surprisingly not as effective as plant aeration in the marsh (38.9 to 42.0 kg O2 ha-1 d-1). This unusually low oxygen transfer efficiency of the diffused aeration was attributed to its low submergence depth of 0.8 m compared to typical depth of 4.5 m. The wetlands consisting entirely of marsh removed similar amounts of C and N without investing additional equipment and energy costs of aerating ponds in the middle of wetlands.

One of the cost-effective and passive methods to treat swine wastewater is using constructed wetlands. The objective of this study was to evaluate the N removal under two N loads in 3 different wetland systems: aerated marsh-pond-marsh (M-P-M), aerated marsh-covered pond-marsh (M-FB-M), and continuous marsh (CM) with two days drain and five days flood cycle. Swine wastewater from an anaerobic lagoon was applied to the constructed wetland cells (11 m wide x 40 m length) at two N loading rates of 7 and 12 kg N ha(-1) day(-1) from June to July and August to September 2005, respectively. Weekly inflow and outflow samples were collected for N, P, TS, and COD analysis. Total N reductions (%) at low and high N loading rates were 85.8 and 51.8; 86.3 and 63.3; and 86.2 and 61.8 for M-P-M, M-FB-M, and CM, respectively. Aeration had no significant (P > 0.05) impact on N removal. However, significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed for wetland systems between low and high N loading rates. No difference (P > 0.05) in N reduction was found among wetland systems. Vegetation uptake of N was negligible, ranging from 1.2 to 1.8%. No significant (P > 0.05) differences in TS and COD removal were observed between the wetland systems.	[Forbes, Dean A.; Reddy, G.

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of different salinities on the efficiency of halotolerant microorganisms for the removal of pollutants in order to evaluate the possibility of their employment for saline wastewater treatment. The efficiency of ammonium removal (34.1 %) was the highest with 0 % NaCl in wastewater and slightly lower (31.8 %) when 2 g/dm(3) saccharose was added to aerated 1.5 % NaCl wastewater. The highest removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the pilot-scale subsurface flow (SSF) CW was 83.6 % when saccharose (2 g/dm(3)) was added to aerated 1.5 % NaCl wastewater. It was found that removal efficiency of the pilot-scale constructed wetland with inoculated halotolerant microorganisms showed a higher sensitivity to aeration and the presence of saccharose than to variation of the salinity of the wastewater. It can be concluded that halotolerant microorganisms, isolated from the Secovlje salterns, are not sensitive to the changes in salinity and are, therefore, an alternative in the treatment of saline wastewater with a constructed wetland. However, with aeration their efficiency could be further improved.

In order to achieve rapid nitrate removal we need multiple strategies including use of constructed wetlands in localized controlled greenhouse environments. In such localized controlled micro-environments higher temperatures can be managed for plant growth in hydroponics system through which nitrate contaminated water is fed for denitrification. Denitrification is a process that converts nitrate to gaseous nitrogen. This process is also referred to as "removal of nutrients". The advantage of denitrification is that less oxygen is needed for the digestion of organic compounds in the aeration basin and specifically selected plants are needed for effective strategy. In the overall strategy to develop effective plant systems for controlled environment removal of nitrate pollution we have developed plant tissue culture technologies to isolate cold tolerant plant species that can be grown in aquatic and hydroponic environments. The use of innovative tissue culture technologies allows isolation of plant clonal lines of single seed phenotype origin that can be screened for cold tolerance and nitrate removal in aquatic zones. Such single seed plant clonal isolations are being evaluated for nitrate removal in the range of 25-50 nag-L-1 in hydroponic environments. The results of optimal removal of nitrate in greenhouse hydroponic studies will be presented. One group of plant species that hold promise for use in controlled greenhouse environments are species of aquatic mints. Strategy for specific clonal screening and use in cold latitude wetlands and greenhouse system for temperature control in the winter will be presented.

The results showed that both oxygen levels and aerobic zones were increased in the wetland substrates. The electric potential (Eh) profiling demonstrated that artificial aeration maintained the pattern of sequential oxic-anoxic-oxic redox zones within the aerated IVCW chambers in winter, while only two oxic-anoxic zones were present inside the non-aerated IVCW in the cold seasons. The nitrification/denitrification processes and organic matter decomposition were enhanced by artificial aeration since the removal efficiency of NH(4)(-)-N and BOD(5) were significantly improved in all seasons, particularly in winter. It seemed that artificial aeration could compensate for the absence of plant-mediated oxygen supply, though the low temperatures and plant dieback still affected the removal efficiency of COD and TN in the winter. Eight hours of artificial aeration per day was sufficient to eliminate the significant accumulation of NO(3)(-)-N previously observed in the effluent from continuously aerated subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. These results suggest that the aerated IVCW could treat domestic sewage more efficiently, especially in winter.

The results showed that the wetland substrate was the sink of nitrogen and phosphorus for the overlying water, and the substrate had better characteristics in adsorption of ammonian(NH4+-N) and total phosphonts(TP) under the aerobic condition and alkaline condition. The intensity of substrate NH4+-N and TP adsorption was directly linear to the pH value. Under non-aerobic condition, the NH4+-N and TP adsorption fluxes were 52 and -0.15 mg/m(2).d (minus represents source), and after aerating, the NH4+-N and TP fluxes increased to 95 and 0.69 mg/m(2).d.

Taiwan introduced contact bed treatment to treat sewage in 2004. The reference design parameters are based on data obtained from developed countries. These foreign designs ignore the unique hydrological environment and climate of Taiwan. This study tried to analyze the water quality of the contact bed treatment system and to assess the efficiency of design parameter, based on that to propose design parameters to similar facilities on Taiwan. This study shows that the out-site contact bed treatment design should be changed to increase the aeration and disinfection parameters with the DO greater than 5 mg/L, BOD(5) optimal concentration of 10-25 mg/L, COD of 32-60 mg/L, SS of 15-25 mg/L, NH(3)-N concentration can be greater than 16 mg/L, hydraulic retention time of two hours, gravel size of 10-15 cm, porosity of 30-50%, with the water flow rate less than 10 cm/s and sludge accumulation of 10 to 15 days. These studies conducted long term observation in accordance with local conditions. The above data are available to provide local design parameters for future follow-up designs.

The MSL system overcomes many of the shortcomings of conventional soil treatment systems such as easy clogging, large land requirement and low hydraulic loading rate. This paper summarizes the structure, purification mechanism and practical application of the systems for different kinds of wastewater treatment. The paper also compares MSL systems with other decentralized systems such as wetland and compact filter systems in their respective structures and treatment efficiencies.

CSF combines sedimentation, infiltration and biodegradation processes to remove oxidizable organics and inorganics of wastewater in a single facility. Operating experience shows hydraulic loading in the range of 0.05-0.25 m(3)/m(2) h and organic loading up to 200-680 g/m(2) d. The results show increase in dissolved oxygen levels, COD removal (from 352 mg/l to 20 mg/l); BOD removal (from 211 mg/l to 7.0 mg/l); suspended solids removal (from 293 mg/l to 16 mg/l): turbidity reduction (from 145 NTU to 5.3 NTU): iron (from 5 mg/l to 0.3 mg/l); arsenic (from 500 mu g/l to 10 mu g/l); total coliform and fecal coliform removal (from 145 x 10(5) to 55 CFU/100 mL and 150 x 10(8) to 110 CFU/100 mL respectively), with desired pathogen levels as per WHO standards, i.e. <= 10(3) CFU/100 mL CSF reveals advantages such as low HRT (0.5-2.0 h), low energy requirement (0.04 kW h/m(3)), no pre-treatment, high dissolved oxygen levels in the effluent, no biosludge production, no mechanical aeration and no odor, fish compatible water quality and evergreen ambience.

Nitrogen present in wastewater, due to its role in eutrophication and potential toxicity to aquatic species, is a focus of primary concern. Constructed wetlands (CWs), a simpler, less costly treatment alternative, have been used to treat domestic wastewater for small communities. Although showing great promise for removing carbonaceous materials from wastewater, wetland systems have not been successful in removing nitrogen mainly due to lack of dissolved oxygen (DO). To enhance nitrogen removal, a novel CW configuration with three stages, towery hybrid constructed wetland (THCW), was designed. The first and third stages were rectangle subsurface horizontal flow CWs, and the second stage was a circular three-layer free-water flow CW. Increased DO by passive aeration of a tower type cascade overflow from the upper layer into the lower layer in the second stage of the wetland enhanced nitrification rates. Denitrification rates were also improved by additional organic matter supplied as a result of bypass influent directly into the second stage. Evergreen tree Pond Cypress (Taxodium ascendens), industrial plants Mat Rush (Schoenoplectus trigueter) and Wild Rice shoots (Zizania aquatica), ornamental floriferous plants Pygmy Waterlily (Nymphaeo tetragona) and Narrow-leaved Cattail (Typha angustifolia) were planted in the wetland. The average percentage of removal was 89%, 85%. 83%, 83% and 64% for total suspended solid. chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, respectively. There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) at low and high hydraulic loads (16 cm/d and 32 cm/d) for performance of THCW. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well as potential nitrification activity and potential denitrification rates measured have shown that nitrification-denitrification is the main mechanism for nitrogen removal in the wetland. THCW also provided additional aesthetic benefits. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study assessed the treatment of azo dye Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and nutrients using five laboratory-scale up-flow constructed wetlands (UFCW) with and without supplementary aeration, and with different emergent plants. Supplementary aeration controlled the size of aerobic and anaerobic zones in the UFCW reactors as evidenced by the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) profile of the UFCW. The AO7 removal efficiency was above 95% in all UFCW reactors and most of the color was extensively removed in the anaerobic region of the UFCW beds. The intermediates produced through the breakage of azo bond were significantly reduced in the UFCW reactors with supplementary aeration. The results indicated the applicability of the UFCW reactors to the treatment of azo dye-containing wastewater. The removals of T-N and T-P were in the range of 60-67% and 26-37%, respectively, among the UFCW reactors. The COD and NH4-N removals in the aerated reactors were about 86 and 96%, respectively. On the other hand, the COD and NH4-N removals were in the range of 78-82% and 41-48%, respectively, in the non-aerated reactors. The supplementary aeration enhanced the removal efficiencies in organic matter, NH4-N and aromatic amines in the UFCW reactors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Macrophytes; Subsurface-flow constructed wetland; Pollutant removal	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITRATE REMOVAL; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; ARTIFICIAL AERATION; MICROCOSM WETLANDS; LOADING RATE; PLANTS; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; PHOSPHORUS	While the positive role of macrophytes on removal efficiency in constructed wetlands has been well established, possible differences in performance between plants species of comparable life forms and sizes are much harder to demonstrate. We reviewed 35 experimental studies published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings on the effect of macrophyte species selection on pollutant removal in SSFCW. The studies cover a wide range of macrophyte species, experimental approaches (from well-replicated microcosm experiments to comparison between full full-size constructed wetlands), climatic conditions (from tropical to cold-temperate) and types of effluent (domestic, industrial, etc.). Frequent methodological limitations in these studies compel caution in the interpretation of their results. Yet, the fact that the majority found some (occasionally large) differences in efficiency between plant species for one or more type of pollutant suggests that macrophyte species selection does matter. However, there is little generalization to be made that could help guide species selection for SSFCW, except for the exact conditions in which the experiments were done. For example, the same pair of species that was tested in different studies occasionally gave opposite results in terms of which one performs best. Also, most studies provided few insights on the mechanisms or plant properties that could explain the observed differences in plant species efficiency. Finally, we discuss other relevant research questions and approaches that could help better guide macrophyte species selection for CW. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of plant and artificial aeration on solids accumulation and biological activities in constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Wetland Pollution Control and Dynamics Conference	2007	Tartua, ESTONIA			Water treatment; Typha angustifolia; Phragmites australis; Mesocosms; Microbial activity; Sulphide	FARM DAIRY WASTEWATERS; REMOVAL EFFICIENCY; SULFATE REDUCTION; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; LOADING RATE; WASTE-WATER; FLOW; PERFORMANCE; MESOCOSMS	In constructed wetlands, solids accumulation may have two consequences with opposing effects on treatment efficiency: it decreases the longevity by reducing void space and it enhances biological activity by favoring biofilm development. The goal of our study was to estimate the effect of plants (presence and species) and artificial aeration on solids accumulation (volatile and inorganic). The horizontal and vertical distribution of solids was sampled using solids traps in 12 constructed wetland mesocosms (5 years old). Microbial density and activity were estimated in the biological fraction of the sampled solids. The effect of plant presence reduced accumulated solids by 26% and sulphide content by 50% sulphide content. There was more solids accumulation in Typha angustifolia units than in Phragmites australis. Also, T angustifolia generated more biological activities at the surface and close to the inlet while conditions were more homogeneous throughout P. australis units. Aeration (1) stimulated biofilm development at the inlet of planted beds, (2) seemed to reduce mineral matter accumulation and (3) generated the same pattern of activities in planted beds enabling to reach a total nitrogen removal rate of up to 0.65 g N m(-2) d(-1).

Three wetland treatment systems were operated with synthetic wastewater (60 mg NH3-NL-1) in a batch mode of fill - 1-week reaction - drain. Each treatment system had a surface flow wetland (unplanted, planted, and planted plus aerated, respectively) with a rooting substrate of sandy loam and limestone pellets, followed by an unplanted subsurface flow wetland. Meanwhile, three surface flow wetlands with a substrate of sandy loam and pave-stone were operated in parallel to the former surface flow wetlands. Influent and effluent were monitored weekly for five cycles. Aeration reduced nitrogen removal due to hindered nitrate reduction. Vegetation maintained pH near neutral and moderate dissolved oxygen, significantly improved ammonia removal by anammox, and had higher TN removal due to coexistence of anammox and denitrification in anaerobic biofilm layers. Nitrite production was at a peak at the residence time of 4-5 d. Relative to pavestone, limestone increased the nitrite mass production peak by 97%. The subsurface flow wetlands removed nitrogen via nitritation and anammox, having an anammox activity of up to 2.4 g N m(-3) d(-1) over a startup operation of two months. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of water level fluctuation on radial oxygen loss, root porosity, and nitrogen removal in subsurface vertical flow wetland mesocosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Denitrification; Nitrification; Oxygen; Typha orientalis; Water quality	PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; METHANE OXIDATION; RICE RHIZOSPHERE; SOIL; AERATION; GROWTH; PLANTS; DENITRIFICATION; ECOPHYSIOLOGY	Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of water level fluctuation on plant radial oxygen loss (ROL), root porosity, plant growth performance, and nitrogen dynamics in vertical subsurface flow wetland mesocosms. Four types of mesocosms; were used: control with static water level, control with fluctuating water level, static water level with plants, and fluctuating water level with plants. Typha orientalis, an emergent macrophyte, was used in this study. Changes of ROL, root porosity, and plant biomass were measured every six weeks. Shoot height and density of plants were also observed. Every two weeks, the nitrogen removal efficiency of the four systems was monitored. Maximum ROL values under static and fluctuating conditions were 7.58 and 2.73 mu mol/g DW/h, respectively. The porosity values of roots under static and fluctuating conditions ranged between 33-47% and 30-37%, respectively. Average removal efficiency of both total nitrogen (TN) and ammonium nitrogen (NH(4)-N) in the fluctuating condition with plants was about 65%, and nitrate nitrogen removal in the static condition with plants was about 75%. Although the water level fluctuation caused a considerable reduction in ROL and root porosity, it clearly produced a significant improvement in TN and NH(4)-N removal. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We studied the effect of 3 different macrophyte species and artificial aeration on the rates of nitrous oxide (N(2)O), carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) production in CW mesocosms over three seasons. CW emitted 2-10 times more GHG than natural wetlands. Overall, CH(4) Was the most important GHG emitted in unplanted treatments. Oxygen availability through artificial aeration reduced CH(4) fluxes. Plant presence also decreased CH(4) fluxes but favoured CO(2) production. Nitrous oxide had a minor contribution to global warming potential (GWP < 15%). The introduction of oxygen through artificial aeration combined with plant presence, particularly Typha angustifolia, had the overall best performance among the treatments tested in this study, including lowest GWP, greatest nutrient removal, and best hydraulic properties.

Eleocharis sphacelata is a freshwater wetland sedge found growing at the edge of lake margins, swamps, lagoons, and bogs within New Zealand, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. It is a perennial rhizomatous herb, with tall green cylindrical culms rising from submerged rhizomes generally buried under water in aerobic soils. A tendency to dominate the deepwater margins makes E. sphacelata crucial to the ecology of this habitat as a source of food, shelter, and protection for invertebrates, birds, and fish. Eleocharis sphacelata is commonly named giant spike-rush, kuta, or paopao. Maori have traditionally used the plant for clothing and warm coverings within whare (houses). Recent interest comes from its use in restoration plantings and constructed wetlands.

The main objective of the study was to compare continuous-flow hybrid CL and LWA filters and batch-operated LWA filters in order to determine optimal loading, design parameters, management schemes and operational regimes for LWA-based FSs in cold climate conditions for the secondary treatment of domestic wastewater. With higher re-circulation rates of treated water, purification efficiency increased in terms of most water quality indicators in both types of filter systems. In the batch-operated FS the highest purification efficiencies of 96% and 51% for BOD(7) and N(tot), respectively, were achieved when the re-circulation rate of 200% was applied. In the continuous-flow FS the highest purification efficiencies of 99% and 81% for BOD(7) and N(tot), respectively, were achieved when the re-circulation rate up to 300% was applied. In order to achieve effective organic matter removal, nitrification/denitrification and TSS removal, the re-circulation rate must be from 100% to 300% of the inflowing wastewater. Both FS designs, the continuous-flow hybrid systems and the batch-operated filters, are suitable for the secondary treatment of domestic wastewater in cold climate conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, this removal often results in the flux of important greenhouse gases (GHG), such as nitrous oxide (N(2)O), carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and methane (CH(4)) that could mitigate the environmental benefits of CWs. We studied the efficiency of artificial aeration and 2 different macrophyte species (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia) on the removal and transformations of nitrogen and GHG gas flux using CW mesocosms supplied with 60 L m(-2) d(-1) of wastewater. Removal of total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was generally high in all beds but resulted in a net production of oxidized nitrogen (NO(y)) in aerated CW mesocosms as compared to ammonium (NH(4)(+)) in non-aerated units. Aerated units emitted less N(2)O when planted with P. australis or left unplanted. Aerated beds and planted mesocosms had lower CH(4) fluxes than non-aerated units and unplanted beds, respectively. Our study suggests that planted systems with artificial aeration have the overall best performances in that they lead to a reduction of GHG flux and promote the release of NO(y) over NH(4)(+) in their effluents.

(cattail)], intermittent artificial aeration and the use of polyhedron hollow polypropylene balls (PHPB) as part of the wetland substrate on nutrient removal from eutrophic Jinhe River water in Tianjin, China. During the entire running period, observations indicated that plants played a negligible role in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal but significantly enhanced ammonia-nitrogen (NH(4)-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)-N) total nitrogen (TN), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus (TP) removal. The introduction of intermittent artificial aeration and the presence of PHPB could both improve COD, NH(4)-N, TN, SRP and TP removal. Furthermore, aerated wetlands containing PHPB performed best; the following improvements were noted: 10.38 g COD/m(2) day, 1.34 g NH(4)-N/m(2) day, 1.04 g TN/m(2) day, 0.07 g SRP/m(2) day and 0.07 g TP/m(2) day removal, if compared to non-aerated wetlands without PHPB being presented.

We studied the seasonal variation of the effects of artificial aeration and three different macrophyte species (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia and Phalaris arundinacea) on N processing (removal rates, transformations and export) using experimental CW mesocosms. Removal of total nitrogen (TN) was higher in summer and in planted and aerated units, with the highest mean removal in units planted with T. anyustifolia. Export of ammonium (NH(4)(+)), a proxy for nitrification limitation, was higher in winter, and in unplanted and non-aerated units. Planted and aerated units had the highest export of oxidized nitrogen (NO(y)), a proxy for reduced denitrification. Redox potential, evapotranspiration (ETP) rates and hydraulic retention times (HRT) were all predictors of TN, NH(4)(+) and NO, export, and significantly affected by plants. Denitrification was the main N sink in most treatments accounting for 47-62% of TN removal, while sediment storage was dominant in unplanted non-aerated units and units planted with P. arundinacea. Plant uptake accounted for less than 20% of the removal.

Immobilized denitrifying bacteria and aeration were added into the canna floating bed. The experimental results showed that these enhancements substantially improved the nitrogen removal efficiency of the floating beds. With the enhancements, total nitrogen removal was 72.1%, ammonia nitrogen oxidation was 100%, nitrate nitrogen removal was 75.8%, nitrite nitrogen removal was 95.9%, and COD removal was 94.6% in 5 days. Without the enhancements, the canna floating bed system removed only 50.4% of the total nitrogen, 22.4% of the nitrate nitrogen, 5.3% of the nitrite nitrogen and 39.9% of the COD, respectively, in 5 days, but did accomplish 100% oxidation of the ammonia nitrogen. The experimental results provide an improved method for the treatment of polluted river water.

To seek suitable sewage treatment technology, investigation and pilot research was conducted in rural places in Taihu Lake region. Field investigation was done by questionnaire and sewage sampling analysis. Demonstration project was built with a biological-ecological process consisting of anaerobic hydrolysis, waterfall aeration contact oxidation and constructed wetland in a village named Linzhuang. The influent and effluent samples of this system were monitored for 6 months. Field investigation data showed sewage indexes in rural villages fluctuated greatly. Operation results of the pilot system indicated this combined process was efficient in pollutants removal Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in the effluent from this process was stably below 50 mg/l, 0.5 mg/l and 12.9 mg/l respectively. COD was mainly removed by anaerobic hydrolysis and contact oxidation, while nitrogen Was mostly distripped by nitrification in contact oxidation unit and denitrification in hydrolysis unit. Most of TP removal was accomplished in the constructed wetland by filter interception, plant adsorption and microbial transformation. Owing to mutually complementary interaction between biological and ecological methods, the performance of this system was not obviously affected by influent and temperature fluctuation. This system was efficient in pollutants removal and cost effective in building and operating.

A fundamental prerequisite of the efficient water quality improvement is the presence of redox potential gradients (connected with the aeration of the system) inside the vegetation bed. Redox properties of a constructed wetland were tested in three longitudinal transects, crossing the vegetation bed from the inflow zone to the outflow using diverse indicators (e.g., Fe(III)/Fe(II), SO(4)(2-)/S(2-)). Approximately 10-25% of iron was reoxidized in samples taken 10 m from the inflow zone in 2006. Redox processes of iron in artificial (constructed wetland) and natural (peat hog) ecosystems were compared. The peat bog was characterized with higher percentages of Fell (usually ca. 90-100%). Thus, the aeration of the peat land was lower in comparison with the constructed wetland. The constructed wetland efficiently reduced Sulfates (average concentrations of 44.7 and 11.2 mg/l at the inflow and the Outflow, resp., in 2007). Organics, expressed as COD(Cr) and BOD(5), and NH(4)(+) were removed with efficiencies of 86.4. 92.2, and 60.4%, respectively. However, total phosphorus (redox processes play a negligible role in this case) was removed only with 39.6% efficiency. Redox properties of the wetland did not significantly depend on the heterogeneity of the treated wastewater flow.

Extraction spectrophotometry with methylene blue served to determine the analyte concentrations in individual samples. The anionic surfactant-removal efficiency depended on actual conditions, mostly the treated water flow intensity, its temperature, and a redox-potential gradient in the longitudinal profile of the wetland bed. It increased with decreasing inflow and increasing temperature. The average efficiency was 83.7% in 2007 and 81.7% in 2008; however, values higher than 85% were often determined during the summer period. On the other hand, the efficiencies were usually lower than 80% in winter, especially in periods with intensive precipitation and inflows. The average concentration of anionic surfactants in water taken at the outflow was lower than 0.65 mg/l (expressed as sodium dodecyl sulfate). The most significant fraction of anionic surfactants (almost 50%) was degraded at the beginning (1 m from the inflow zone) of the wetland bed. The rhizosphere aeration via the vegetation roots strongly supported the anionic-surfactant removal.

Results demonstrated that mean percentage removal of COD and NH(4)(+)-N in this wetland with air-pipe were 75 and 89%, respectively, much higher than that in the same design without the air pipe. Compared with conventional constructed wetland systems, good quality effluent can be achieved in the vertical flow constructed one with an air-pipe introduced. Mass balance calculation of oxygen showed that oxygen supply by the air-pipe was remarkable (29.171 g/m(2).day). The biological population analysis results showed that the amounts of total bacteria, nitrite bacteria and nitrate bacteria in the vertical flow constructed wetland with air pipe were higher indicating that the nitrification potential ability was higher than in the conventional constructed wetland.

Ongoing monitoring of the treatment system has shown significant reductions in the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)) throughout the system with levels decreasing by up to 76.7% across the constructed wetland cells following high anti- and de-icing fluid applications. However, continued exposure to BOD(5) concentrations exceeding the design target has resulted in anaerobic conditions in the wetland. The addition of nutrients to the treatment system has resulted in improved removal efficiency for elevated BOD(5) loadings in the aerated reservoir from 25.5% to 47.5%, The addition of different nutrient dosing regimes to complementary pilot-scale planted and unplanted vertical flow columns showed average but statistically insignificant BOD(5) removal percentage increases from 61.9 +/- 21.1% to 70.8 +/- 26.5%, respectively, in planted columns over a 7-day period. There is an overall improvement in the performance of the system, but operational reviews are continuing.

EVALUATION OF A DIFFUSED AIR AERATION SYSTEM FOR A CONSTRUCTED WETLAND RECEIVING DAIRY WASTEWATER	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Agricultural wastewater; Artificial aeration; Treatment wetlands	AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; REMOVAL EFFICIENCY; TREATMENT DESIGN; COLD-CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE	Treatment systems that utilize natural processes, such as constructed wetlands, offer a sustainable and economical alternative to conventional wastewater treatment. Dairy farm wastewater was loaded into two similar (similar to 100 m(2) each) surface flow treatment wetlands in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia, Canada, at an average rate of 65 kg BOD(5) ha(-1) d(-1). A diffused air aeration system was installed in one of the wetlands based on a design oxygen requirement of 3.52 kg O(2) d(-1). Wetland treatment performance was evaluated over 20 months (September 2002 to April 2004), during which time the aeration system operated for 13 months. The wetlands were monitored intensively for dissolved oxygen (DO), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia-nitrogen (NH(3)-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)(-)-N), total phosphorus (TP), and Escherichia coli. Both the aerated and non-aerated wetlands provided effective year-round wastewater treatment. Artificial aeration significantly increased TKN and NH(3)-N mass reductions (P < 0.001). Aeration did not significantly affect the removal of BOD(5), TSS, NO(3)(-)-N, TP, and E. coli. The data suggest that the benefits of wetland aeration are not great enough to warrant its widespread adoption for small-scale agricultural systems.	[MacPhee, N. B.; Wood, J.

Pollutant removal within hybrid constructed wetland systems in tropical regions	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						constructed wetlands; heavy metal; hybrid natural purification systems; nutrient	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; MASS-BALANCE; TRACE-METALS; FLOW	Hybrid constructed wetlands have received tremendous interests for water quality enhancement due to insufficient sewage treatment and groundwater deterioration in Taiwan. The main objectives of this study were to investigate pollutant removal efficiencies and mechanisms within field-scale hybrid natural purification systems. The studied hybrid constructed wetland systems include an oxidation pond, two serial surface flow wetlands with a cascade in between, and a subsurface flow wetland receiving secondary treated dormitory sewage. The average SS, BOD and COD percent removal efficiency was 86.7, 86.5 and 57.8%, respectively. The ratio of BOD to COD decreased from 0.65 in the initial aerobic compartment to 0.21 in anoxic parts of the systems, indicating most biological degradable materials were decomposed in the aerobic oxidation pond and surface flow wetlands. Heavy metal removal percentages of copper and zinc were 72.9 and 68.3%, respectively. Sedimentation and plant uptake are the possible sinks for metals retention. Significant phosphorus removal was not achieved in this study. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammonium decreased from 4.08 to 1.43 and 3.74 to 1.21 mg/L, respectively, while nitrate nitrogen increased from 1.91 to 3.85 mg/L within the aerobic oxidation pond and surface flow wetlands. This result demonstrated nitrification occurring within aerobic compartments. The nitrate nitrogen continued to decrease from 3.85 to 1.43 mg/L within the anoxic subsurface wetlands mainly through denitrification transformation. Total nitrogen removal was from 7.61 to 3.61 mg/L, with the percentage removal of total nitrogen around 52.6%. The primary nitrogen removal and transformation mechanisms within the studied wetland systems were nitrification within aerobic followed by denitrificaiton within anaerobic systems. The emergent macrophytes enhance aeration through oxygen transferring that attributing the higher organic matter removal and nitrification rate. The hybrid wetland systems are viable options of pollutants transformation and removal in tropical countries, while tertiary wastewater systems are too costly or unable to operate. Effluent of purified systems can comply with local surface water criteria rendering for groundwater recharge.	[Yeh, T. Y.; Wu, C.

The main objective of CWM1 is to predict effluent concentrations from constructed wetlands without predicting gaseous emissions. CWM1 describes aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic processes and is therefore applicable to both horizontal and vertical flow systems. 17 processes and 16 components (8 soluble and 8 particulate) are considered. CWM1 is based on the mathematical formulation as introduced by the IWA Activated Sludge Models (ASMs). It is important to note that besides the biokinetic model a number of other processes including porous media hydrodynamics, the influence of plants, the transport of particles/suspended matter to describe clogging processes, adsorption and desorption processes and physical re-aeration must be considered for the formulation of a full model for constructed wetlands	[Langergraber, Guenter] Univ Nat Resources & Appl Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, Inst Sanit Engn & Water Pollut Control, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Rousseau, Diederik P.

In the state of Louisiana, USA, many municipalities treat wastewater using natural systems, such as lagoons and wetlands, rather than conventional wastewater treatment technologies. Nearly all research to date has focused on the fate of PhACs in conventional treatment plants, not constructed and natural wetlands. In the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for Mandeville, Louisiana, USA, wastewater flows of 76000 m(3) d(-1) are treated in a series of aeration lagoons (basins), followed by a constructed wetland and UV disinfection, before being discharged into a natural forested wetland (i.e. Bayou Chinchuba) and eventually, Lake Pontchartrain. Thirteen out of the 15PhACs investigated were detected in the wastewater inflow to the treatment plant. Only 9 of the 13 compounds were above the detection limits at the treatment plant effluent. The concentrations of most compounds were reduced by greater than 90% within the plant, while carbamazepine and sotalol were only reduced by 51% and 82%, respectively. The percent reductions observed in the Mandeville system were greater than reduction rates reported for conventional WWTPs; perhaps due to the longer treatment time (similar to 30 days). Most target PhACs were not completely removed before discharge into Lake Pontchartrain, although their collective annual loading was reduced to less than 1 kg and down to ppb with significant potential for dilution in the large lake.

Removal of High Organic Loads from Winery Wastewater by Aquatic Plants	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						floating and emergent plants; winery wastewater; treatment; high organic loads; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; turbidity reduction; water quality	CONSTRUCTED TREATMENT WETLAND; EICHHORNIA-CRASSIPES; HYACINTH PONDS; WASTEWATERS; MACROPHYTES; TERRESTRIAL; REDUCTION; SEWAGE; MANURE	Laboratory- and field-scale purification tests of raw and diluted winery wastewater (WWW) were carried out using aquatic plants at high organic loads. The laboratory tests were performed using artificial light at 1800 to 1900 lux. The objective of the current study was to define the potential of floating and emergent aquatic macrophytes and the microorganisms attached to their roots, to reduce high organic loads that characterize WWW, thereby providing, for these effluents, an effective treatment and management system. These microorganisms are believed to have a major role in the treatment process. In this context, the potential of floating and emergent macrophytes to improve the water quality of raw compared with diluted WWW was evaluated. In raw WWW (chemical oxygen demand [COD] 5.6 g/L), growth inhibition of both water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water pennywort (Hydrocotyle umbellata) was observed. A 1: 1 dilution of WWW with fresh (tap) water facilitated growth of these plants. At this dilution level, growth of pennywort was limited, while that of water hyacinth was robust. In terms of reductions in biochemical oxygen demand, COD, and total suspended solids, both water hyacinth and pennywort performed better in diluted compared with raw WWW. At 1: 1 and 1: 3 dilution, 95.9 to 97% of the COD was removed after 23 days, in the presence of Hydrocotyle and Eichhornia plants and aeration. The capacity of new emergent plants to remove high organic loads from WWW, at enhanced kinetics, was demonstrated. This unique property was tested and compared with the role of the gravel media that support growth of the high-capacity emergent plants. In the presence of reed and salt marsh plants, 83 to 99% of the COD was removed within a period of 24 to 29 days, at 1.5:1 dilution. The new emergent plants proved to be effective, even at record high levels of COD. At an initial level of 16 460 mg/L, the COD was brought down to 2870 mg/L after 24 days (82.6% removal), while 12 230 mg/L was lowered to 106 mg/L, giving 99.1% removal from the highly contaminated WWW. These results indicate a significant extension of the range of applicability of emergent plants for the treatment of raw and diluted WWW. In this context, daily removal rates as high as 2000 mg/ L in the first treatment days, and an average of over 550 mg/ L per day in 24 days of treatment, were recorded. The indoor experiments were conducted without proper acclimatization of the plants to high-strength WWW. This might have affected the plants' health in case, with acclimatization, they might have behaved differently. Water Environ. Res., 80, 806 (2008).

The plant was composed of a first stage of vertical filters (fed with raw wastewater), followed by a second stage of horizontal filters. It was monitored over one year, measuring hydraulic conditions, physico-chemical conditions, gas emission, oxygen levels in the gas phase as well as regular treatment performance by 24-h composite samples. Different vertical filter configurations (media depth, intermediate and passive aeration system) were tested as well as two horizontal filter designs. Nitrogen removal is discussed in terms of the efficiency of each stage in relation to the season and the load applied. This study indicates limits for systems configuration and suggests some design avenues for hybrid systems to reach high and regular levels of nitrogen removal with reasonable surface area per person.

Evaluation of submerged surface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands for recirculating tilapia production systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						SSF wetlands; tilapia; aquaculture; recirculation; nitrification; denitrification	ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER; PERFORMANCE; AQUACULTURE; CULTURE; SHRIMP; CONFIGURATION; EFFLUENTS; NITROGEN; REMOVAL	A recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) treating tilapia production wastewaters used a two-step process combining a simple clarifier and a submerged surface flow (SSF) constructed wetlands for suspended solids removal and removal of nitrogenous compounds. This system successfully supported a commercial scale level of production (>35 kg/m(3)) for over 36 months of operation. The innovative SSF wetland design incorporated a high hydraulic loading rate (3.03 m/day), larger effective diameter media (380 mm), and a deeper bed depth (0.90 m) than previously suggested design guidelines. The SSF wetland flow pattern was characterized as plug flow with dispersion, but this analysis based on bed volume data indicated that media porosity was reduced from an assumed design value of 54-27% under operating conditions. The TSS, TAN, NO0-N, and NO3-N, percent mass removal for the SSF wetlands was 67.2, 46.0, 87.0, and 40.6, respectively. The TSS, TAN, NO2-N, and NO3-N mass removal for the SSF wetlands was 8.21, 0.58, 0.63, and 0.93 g/(m(2) day), respectively. Optimal performance of the SSF wetlands with simultaneous removal of TAN and NO2-N, and NO3-N occurred at TAN loadings less than 6.0 g/(m(2) day). Bed depth and hydraulic loading rates were major factors controlling this aerobic/anaerobic removal of nitrogen. The wetlands appeared to be oxygen limited at very high TAN loadings above 6.0 g/ ((2) day). Site elevation (1189 m) and warm culture temperatures (similar to 25 degrees C) contributed, but supplemental aeration could provide better TAN removal. Summary of design parameters were presented. Mean K-T values calculated for TSS, TAN, NO2-N, and NO3-N were 9.861, 0.614, 20.033, and 8.292 days(-1) compared favorably to other SSF systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Zachritz, W.

Treatment of polluted river water by a gravel contact oxidation system constructed under riverbed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ecological engineering; gravel contact oxidation treatment system; loading rate; packed-bed reactor; water quality	OPEN-CHANNEL FLOW; WASTE-WATER; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; WETLANDS; EXPERIENCE	The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment efficiency of a gravel contact oxidation treatment system which was newly constructed under the riverbed of Nan-men Stream located at the Shin Chu City of Taiwan. The influent and effluent water samples were taken periodically for the analyses of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, five-day biological oxygen demand, NH(4)(+)-N. The results showed that the average removal rates of five-day biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids and NH(4)(+)-N were 33.6% (between -6.7% and 82.1%), 56.3% (between -83.0% and 93.4%) and 10.7% (between -13.0% and 83.3%), respectively. The calculated mean first order reaction rate constant for five-day biological oxygen demand was 4.58/day with a standard deviation of 4.07/day and for NH(4)(+)-N was 2.15/day with a standard deviation of 5.68/day. Therefore, it could be said that this gravel-contact-oxidation system could effectively remove biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and NH(4)(+)-N in river water at a relatively short hydraulic retention time, although its pollutant treatment efficiency was not quite stable. However, to reach better or more stable treatment efficiency, aeration might sometimes be necessary to increase the dissolved oxygen in influent river water. And, longer hydraulic retention time of the system might also be required to increase NH(4)(+)-N removal efficiency.	[Juang, D.

Pathogen removal from municipal wastewater in Constructed Soil Filter	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						constructed soil filter (CSF); soil biotechnology; wastewater; bacterial removal rate constant; pathogen removal	SYSTEM; CONTAMINANTS; WETLANDS; REUSE; PLANT	In this work, a Constructed Soil Filter (CSF) system has been configured for the treatment of wastewater wherein we recreate a soil ecosystem for water purification. Purification capacity and seasonal variability of three such CSF facilities for indicator organisms as well as enteric pathogens monitored over 9-17 months are presented. Indicator organisms include total coliform, fecal coliform, fecal streptococci, heterotrophic plate count, Enterococcus fecalis, actinomycetes, and coliphage. Enteric pathogens include Escherichia coli 25922, E. coli O157:147, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis. All three sites show bacterial removal rate constant (k(d)) in the range of 0.4-1.3h(-1) which is very high in comparison to the reported values from field as well as lab studies. Log removal for pathogens is typically 2-3 log orders. However, by extended recycling up to 5 log orders removal could be achieved. Among the three sites, k(d) values were in the order of site II > site I > site III, which is also the order of their commissioning, suggesting that these system matures with age. Low hydraulic retention time (0.5-2.0h), no pretreatment, high removal efficiency, no mechanical aeration, very low energy requirement, and green ambience are the unique features of CSF.

(cattail) was tested with eutrophic river water in Tianjin ( China). In contrast with the nonaerated wetland, aeration enhanced ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus removal: 10.1, 4.7, 10.2, and 8.8% for aeration in the middle, and 25.1, 10.0, 7.7, and 7.4% for aeration at the bottom of the substrate, respectively. Analysis of above-ground plant biomass indicated that intermittent aeration restrains the increase in biomass, but stimulates assimilation of nitrogen and phosphorus into stems and leaves. Additional total nitrogen removal of 116 kg N/ha and 126 kg N/ha by harvested above-ground T latifolia biomass for intermittent artificial aeration in the middle and at the bottom of the wetland substrate, respectively, was observed. Outflow water quality of aerated subsurface vertical-flow wetlands was better than the one in the nonaerated wetlands during the whole period of the test run. Artificial aeration improved nitrogen and phosphorus removal, especially during the very hot month of August.

Therefore it is of great importance to develop innovative methods to enhance oxygen supply in the CW matrix. This paper focuses on and describes the methods used to enhance oxygen supply in CWs. Also, a pilot scale experimental batch-operated lightweight aggregate (LWA) filter system (FS) consisting of eight identical LWA filter cells (with a depth of 1.15 m and an area of 1 m(2) each) was established during the summer of 2005 for the treatment of municipal wastewater. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the experimental batch-operated FS on the basis of performance indicators. During the experiments, the effect of different operational regimes on the purification efficiency of the filter system was also investigated. The highest purification efficiencies of 96% and 51% for BOD7 and N-tot, respectively, were achieved when the recirculation rate of 200% was applied at the hydraulic retention time of similar to 2 days. The highest organic matter removal rate of the experimental FS as K-BHT=0.19 m d(-1) is approximately two times higher than the removal rate of typical horizontal-flow CWs. However, the highest aeration capacity of 21.1 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1) is somewhat lower than the average aeration capacity of vertical-flow CWs, and substantially lower than the aeration capacity of a VF filter with re-circulation or tidal-flow systems. As the aeration capacity of the system partly depends on the oxygen demand of inflow wastewater, it is necessary to carry out studies of shorter hydraulic loading rates in order to optimize the performance of experimental batch-operated FSs.

Results are presented in a series of performance charts that relate effluent concentrations to influent mass loadings. A statistical approach has been developed that allows the application of confidence intervals to system performance. Performance data is presented for predicted median (50th-percentile) and 90th-percentile effluent concentrations. Aeration was found to improve removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and to a lesser extent, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Benefits of aeration include lower median effluent concentrations at a given influent mass loading, less variability in effluent quality, and lower background concentrations (C*). In contrast, aeration was observed to have no impact on total phosphorus (TP) or fecal coliform bacteria removal.

(river bulrush) to phosphorus (P) removal from dairy-farm effluent in a cold climate constructed wetland. After 3 years of operation (1,073 days), both nonaerated wetland cell 3 (C3) and aerated cell 4 (C4) exhibited a sharp decline in dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) storage, indicating wetlands saturation. The quantities of DRP stored during the three growing seasons (433 days) represented only 10.0%(C3) and 17.7%(C4) of the total amount of DRP (435.06 +/- 2.3g m(-2), 97.02kg) added to each cell (C3 and C4) over the entire 3-year period. However, of the total DRP retained by both wetland cells during 1,073 days of operation, the quantities stored during the three growing seasons (433 days) represented 50.3%(C3) and 36.50%(C4) of the total DRP retention. This indicated that vegetation had an important role in the overall DRP storage regardless of supplemental aeration. Overall, nonaerated C3 DRP mass removal efficiency during the 3-year period of investigation was low, averaging 19.9%. Aerated C4 DRP mass removal efficiency was 2.4-fold higher, averaging 48.4%. Belowground (BG) biomass had significantly higher (p < 0.001) P content than aboveground (AG) biomass, throughout the 3-year period of investigation.

Small scale recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland (RVFCW) for the treatment and reuse of wastewater	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						vertical flow constructed wetland; wastewater reuse; wastewater treatment	IRRIGATION; GREYWATER	The quantity of freshwater available worldwide is declining, revealing a pressing need for its more efficient use. Moreover, in many developing countries and lightly populated areas, raw wastewater is discarded into the environment posing serious ecological and health problems. Unfortunately, this situation will persist unless low-cost, effective and simple technologies are brought in. The aim of this study is to present such a treatment method, a novel setup which is termed recirculating vertical flow constructed wetland (RVFCW). The RVFCW is composed of two components: (i) a three-layer bed consisting of planted organic soil over an upper layer of filtering media (i.e. tuff or beads) and a lower layer of limestone pebbles, and (ii) a reservoir located beneath the bed. Wastewater flows directly into the plant root zone and trickles down through the three-layer bed into the reservoir, allowing passive aeration. From the reservoir the water is recirculated back to the bed, several times, until the desired purification is achieved. The results obtained show that the RVFCW is an effective and convenient strategy to treat (domestic, grey and agro) wastewater for re-use in irrigation. The system performance is expected to be further improved once current optimization experiments and mathematical modeling studies are concluded.	[Gross, A.; Sklarz, M. Y.; Yakirevich, A.; Soares, M.

This can be labour intensive and can cause, in some cases, nitrate contamination of groundwater. In this study a simple pilot-scale horizontal flow biofilm reactor (HFBR) with a step-feed was developed and tested at a dairy farm site in County Offaly, Ireland for partial remediation of this soiled water prior to landspreading. During the 122-day study, the top surface plan area (TSPA) hydraulic loading rate was 50 L/m(2)/day. Influent concentrations averaged: 2904.2mg total chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L, 950 mg 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)/L and 177.9mg total nitrogen (TN)/L. Between Days 1 and 45 frequent ambient temperatures below 4 degrees C inhibited the build-up of biomass resulting in low removals. From Day 45 the HFBR unit removed 74.9% total COD and 69.6% BOD(5), equivalent to TSPA removals of 108.8 g COD/m(2)/day and 33.1 gBOD(5)/m(2)/day. On Sheet 29, by the end of the study, the NH(4)-N had reduced from 123.1 mg/L in the influent to 37.0 mg/L. TN removal in the reactor averaged 56.0% equating to a TSPA removal rate of 5.0 g TN/m(2)/day. The HFBR does not require any mechanical aeration, was simple and inexpensive to construct and can provide a robust and economical alternative for the remediation of agricultural soiled water before landspreading.

Efficiency of reed beds in treating dairy wastewater	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEM; DIRTY WATER; FARM WASTEWATERS; SUSPENDED-SOLIDS; LOADING RATE; PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; DESIGN	At dairy farms in the UK, dirty water is produced from dairy wash water, runoff from soiled yard areas and in some cases silage effluent. it typically contains organic matter, solid matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and pathogens. The purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis that reed beds can be used to treat high-strength agricultural effluent of 5-d biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) up to 6000 mgl(-1), following either dilution with treated water or pre-treatment such as intensive aeration. The experimental process was designed to treat up to 1/50th of the average volume of 25 m(3) d(-1) of wastewater produced on the farm. When 5001 d-1 wastewater had been pre-treated in an intensive aeration unit BOD5 removals of the order 98.6% occurred in the aeration plant, 75.1% in the reed bed and 99.6% in the whole system incorporating the reed bed. However, the supply of a smaller volume of 501 d(-1) of raw dirty water diluted with a recycle of 1100 1 d(-1) of treated water to the reed bed only, led to removal rates of BOD5 as low as 58%. A mathematical model based on the tidal flow of water and first-order BOD5 removal was applied to predict the outlet concentration of BOD5 from the reed beds. During the summer months the correlation between predicted and actual BOD5 was high, as indicated by a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.882, but in the winter months the correlation was poorer, with a correlation coefficient of 0.763.

Influence of plants and organic matter on the nitrogen removal in laboratory-scale model subsurface flow constructed wetlands inoculated with anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria	ENGINEERING IN LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						bioremediation; constructed wetlands; denitrification; nitrification	WASTE-WATER; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; OXIDATION; NITRITE; NITRIFICATION; REDUCTION; AERATION; NITRATE; ANAMMOX; CARBON	Anaerobic oxidation of ammonium has become an alternative for the treatment of wastewater with high ammonium loads, and it was also suggested to be involved in the nitrogen removal process in constructed wetlands. Nonetheless, its role has not been well evaluated as yet. In this paper, results of a lab-scale study are presented focusing on the evaluation of the role of Anammox bacteria, plants, applied ammonia, nitrite nitrogen loads, and the presence of organic matter in nitrogen transformation processes in subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. The inoculation of the experimental model wetlands with active Anammox biomass increased the total nitrogen and ammonium removal rates to values up to 5.7 g N/m(2) d, which is almost 10 times higher than those values reported for subsurface flow constructed wetlands. Although the presence of plants caused a higher removal rate, the role of the plants became less important with high nitrite influent concentration. Because the unplanted experimental system without the addition of any organic carbon source showed also high nitrogen removal rates, it can be concluded that beside the potential for "conventional" denitrification in the planted systems the main mechanism for explaining the high nitrogen removal rates obtained during the experiments was the anaerobic ammonia oxidation. The assay of the formation of hydrazine from hydroxylamine and the findings of the molecular biology tests fitted with the positive results for potential Anammox activity obtained in the bottle test. The addition of organic carbon, specifically acetate, apparently had no great influence on Anammox activity, which is in agreement with the findings reported by other authors. Nevertheless, the addition influenced the redox potential. Some questions are still left open, which are mainly associated with the scaling up of these results and the inoculation of Anammox biomass in full-scale systems.

Five HSSF CWs were fed for 10 months with low loaded synthetic domestic wastewater, using theoretical hydraulic residence time of 7.6 days. The plant species under study were the following: Phragmites australis (CW1), Lythrum salicaria (CW3), Cladium rnariscus (CW4) and Iris pseudacorus (CW5). CW2 was not planted and this was used as control. Qualitative measurements determined a greater growth of Lythrum salicaria and Iris pseudacorus than the others. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were very low in the entire bulk liquid of all the CWs. Also ORP values were very similar in all wetlands, dealing with facultative anaerobic environments. All planted wetlands improved pollutants removal compared with the unplanted control wetland. The performances in terms of COD, TN, TP and SO(4)(2-) removal obtained by the different CWs were in the ranges 80-90%, 35-55%, 15-40% and 45-60% respectively. Lythrum salicaria and Iris pseudacorus, which exhibited greater growth, were always the most efficient species that improved not only nutrients plant uptake but also other microbial removal processes probably due to a higher aeration potential, such as nitrification or aerobic respiration. Sulphate reduction was the most important mechanism for COD removal. Cladium mariscus, an autochthonous plant that grows in the south-central Iberian Peninsula, was less efficient than Lythrum salicaria and Iris pseudacorus, but improved the unplanted wetland wastewater efficiency.

Drainage has become a science of control, storage and (re)use while meeting triple bottom-line requirements (environment, social and economic assessments). Controlled drainage in rural settings aims at maintaining a groundwater table regime that will provide adequate rootzone aeration and soil salinity control but will not remove or use more water than necessary. In urban and peri-urban environments, the philosophy of water sensitive urban design (WSUD) aims at an integrated approach to urban water management through emphasising sensitivity to water in urban design. Urban landscape and architectural building elements now combine the areas of controlling flood flows, detention and treatment of stormwater and the reuse of stormwater as their principal functionalities. Constructed wetlands treat stormwater for recharge of aquifers and subsequent recovery for non-potable reuse. The increase in population, the urbanisation of rural and lowland (coastal-) areas, and the emergence of mega-cities together call for state-of-the-art drainage design as part of integrated water resources management at a river basin scale.

Some pertinent W/D ratios suitable for the Three Gorges Reservoir Region are studied, which can provide dependable academic evidence in expanding the applied area of the land treatment system. The effect of three different aeration is emphatically researched when CRI is applied to treat COD, TN and TP in the sewage under three different W/D ratios. The results show that 1:3 is the most suitable ratio under the current experimental conditions. For the removal of COD, ratio should be chosen considering abundant nutritional materials and aerobic recovery. W/D ratio is contrary to the removal rate of TN. The smaller ratio and longer drying time favor the removal of nitrogen. W/D ratio has less relationship to the removal of TR Aeration through plants has no meaning to the removal of COD. Plants have an obvious significance to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorous.

Treatment of landfill leachate using an aerated, horizontal subsurface-flow constructed wetland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						aeration; ammonia; clogging; cold climate; constructed wetland; horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF); iron; landfill leachate; nitrogen	DENITRIFICATION; CARBON	A pilot-scale subsurface-flow constructed wetland was installed at the Jones County Municipal Landfill, near Anamosa, Iowa, in August 1999 to demonstrate the use of constructed wetlands as a viable low-cost treatment option for leachate generated at small landfills. The system was equipped with a patented wetland aeration process to aid in removal of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen. The high iron content of the leachate caused the aeration system to cease 2 years into operation. Upon the installation of a pretreatment chamber for iron removal and a new aeration system, treatment efficiencies dramatically improved. Seasonal performance with and without aeration is reported for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH(4)-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)-N). Since winter air temperatures in Iowa can be very cold, a layer of mulch insulation was installed on top of the wetland bed to keep the system from freezing. When the insulation layer was properly maintained (either through sufficient litterfall or replenishing the mulch layer), the wetland sustained air temperatures of as low as -26 degrees C without freezing problems.

In summer 2002 a vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) CW (total area 37.4 M2) was added as the first stage of the system. Data from 18 sampling wells installed in Kodijarve HSSF CW from two periods is compared: I st period - January 2000-April 2002 (before the VSSF CW was built); 2nd period -October 2002-December 2004 (after the construction of the VSSF filter). The VSSF CW has remarkably improved aerobic conditions in both beds of the HSSE Apart from total phosphorus concentrations in the right bed and nitrate nitrogen concentrations in the outflow of both beds, all of the water quality indicators (dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, biological oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total nitrogen and total iron) improved after the construction of the VSSF filter. Typically, purification processes in the HSSF CW were dependent on oxygen supply, which was partly influenced by the water level inside the filter beds. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Twelve 1 m 2 mesocosms located in a controlled greenhouse environment were used to test two species of macrophytes (Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia), three loading rates (30, 60, and 90 L.m(-2).d(-1)), and presence or absence of artificial aeration at the intermediate loading rate. There was no effect of any variable (macrophytes, loading, aeration) on total suspended solids (TSS) or chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Artificial aeration improved nitrogen removal while higher loading rates diminished removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Macrophytes improved nitrogen and phosphorus removal, but this effect varied depending on loading rates and presence or absence of artificial aeration. We found no differences between Phragmites and Typha for treatment of trout fish farm wastewater. Under summer conditions, our results suggest that artificial aeration could be used to improve nitrogen removal by HSSFCWs.

One site is inland and the other is close to the coast. Larvae of disease vector mosquitoes were present at various times in the wetlands, especially in summer and autumn. The proportion of early instars (1st and 2nd) was greater than that of later ones (3rd and 4th). Dissolved oxygen was negatively, and temperature was positively, associated with the proportion of dips containing larvae. For the coastal site we noted that larvae were more common during draw-down of water for maintenance and also as the system started to come online. Vegetation associated with larvae included dense Typha orientalis and algae. Where there were several types of plants, such as at the coastal site, plant density and water depth were not significantly related to larval presence. Where there were several types of macroinvertebrates there were fewer dips positive for larvae. To provide water treatment capacity and minimal mosquito production we concluded that design should include a variety of plant types, discouraging low dissolved oxygen (for example, by aeration) and ongoing maintenance should be carried out in winter or spring, when mosquitoes are fewer than in summer.

The pilot system consisted of four subsurface flow treatment cells operated in an upward vertical flow mode and equipped with subsurface aeration lines. The treatment system showed minimal capability for methyl-tert-butyl ether removal, but did effectively remove total petroleum hydrocarbons-deisel range organics and total benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-, m-, and p-xylenes (total BTEX). Effluent benzene concentrations were less than 0.05 mg/L in 70% of the samples from a treatment cell using subsurface aeration and a wetland sod amendment. Based on 1 year of operating data, cumulative mass removal approached 80% for benzene and 88% for total BTEX.

Over a 12-month monitoring period BOD and TSS removals were higher, and effluent ammonia concentrations lower, in the RF than in the CW (>75% vs. 25-75%, and 3.6 mg N L-1 vs. 6 mg N L-1, respectively). However, the ammonia concentration was lower in the CW effluent than in the aerated RF effluent during mid-July to mid-September (1.1 mg N L-1 vs. 2.2 mg N L-1), but in winter it was higher than the influent concentration. Overall the performance of the aerated RF was better and more consistent than that of the CW.

Formation of redox potential gradients inside such a system strongly influences the wastewater-treatment efficiency. Individual oxidation forms of sulfur, and dissolved and precipitated manganese forms were determined in the vegetation bed of the constructed wetland. The aim of the speciation analysis was to contribute to the characterization of its redox properties. Sulfur was mostly oxidized at the inflow. The concentration of sulfates at the inflow varied from 25 to 55 mg/l, while concentration of sulfides was always lower than 6.0 mg/l and mostly even lower than 1.0 mg/l. However, sulfates were reduced during the pretreatment and the wastewater flow through the vegetation bed. The concentration of total manganese varied from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/l. Approximately 60% of Mn was precipitated at the inflow. The content of precipitated Mn forms declined to ca. 40-50% at the inflow zone. this content was almost constant across the vegetation bed to the outflow when water was sampled from 60-cm depth. However, the content of precipitated Mn forms increased to ca. 74% for samples from 20-cm depth. With respect to the aeration of the system, manganese can be precipitated as MnO(2) in these samples.

The aim was to find optimal operating regimes (varying hydraulic loading rates, loading intervals, recirculation regimes and regimes of hydraulic retention time) for the use of analogous CWs in cold climates. The hybrid wetland system consists of two parallel systems designed on the same principle: a vertical subsurface flow (VSSF) filter followed by a horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) filter. The VSSF filter of one system (the left filter) is filled with crushed limestone, while the other (right) is filled with light weight aggregates (LWA). Both HSSF filters are filled with LWA. From December 2005 until December 2006, water samples from the outlet of the septic tank and the outlet of both VSSF and HSSF filters were taken once a week. In both systems, a combination of decreasing hydraulic load (from 52 to 14 mm d-1) and increasing recirculation rate (from 34 to 300%) caused a significant increase in the purification efficiency of BOD7 (from 58 to 99%), N-tot (from 11 to 82%), and NH4-N (from - 16 to 83%). In both systems, the removal efficiency of P,, did not show any significant correlation with hydraulic load, whereas in the right (LWA) system, the increasing recirculation rate significantly increased P-tot removal. The dynamics of the COD value was analogous to that of the BOD7 value, but no significant differences were found between the removal efficiency of total suspended solids (TSS) of different flow regimes. Likewise, water temperature did not show a significant correlation between the purification efficiency of all of the studied water quality indicators. For the successful functioning of hybrid CWs in a cold climate, optimal hydraulic load should be <= 20 mm d-1 with a recirculation rate of 150-300%.

Interaction of oxygen concentration and retention of pollutants in vertical flow constructed wetlands for CSO treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CSO treatment; filter layer; mini sensors; oxygen availability; retention soil filter		The EU Water Framework. Directive (WFD) calls for a good quality of all water bodies. Retention soil filters (RSF) have been developed to treat discharges from combined sewers systems. RSF have proved over the past 15 years to be the most effective measure to meet the EU WFD standards, especially for small or particularly sensitive receiving waters, which require an enhanced reduction of emissions from combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The paper presents results from laboratory-scale experiments, in which the oxygen measurement in the filter plays a main role. The results show remarkable differences in oxygen concentrations in different filter depths. The highest oxygen consumption takes place in the Upper part of the filter. In the lower part the re-aeration of sewage from the soil air dominates. This indicates that the biological activity is limited to the upper part of the filter. The availability of oxygen in the filter is a sign for degradation of wastewater compounds (ammonium, COD) under certain conditions and already takes place during the filter operation. The removal of ammonium especially cannot be strictly divided into phases of sorption during the loading and oxidation during the dry period any more.

We tested the contribution of artificial aeration on pollutant removal in summer and winter, with a combination of planted, unplanted, aerated and non-aerated mesocosms treating a reconstituted fish farm effluent. Artificial aeration slightly enhanced TSS removal in all seasons regardless of treatment, probably by maintaining empty space in the head part of the gravel bed. In winter the reduction in COD removal in non-aerated mesocosms compared to, summer was totally compensated for in aerated mesocosms, in both planted and Implanted units. Artificial aeration improved summer and winter TKN removal for Implanted units, but the additional aeration did not fully compensate for the absence of plants, which suggests that the role of macrophytes goes beyond the sole addition of oxygen in the rhizosphere. Artificial aeration also improved TKN removal in planted units, but to a lower extent than for unplanted units. Our results suggest that artificial aeration represents a promising approach to improve removal efficiency in horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSFCW), especially for fresh water fish farms in cold climate, where artificial aeration is readily available.

Four constructed wetlands, employing horizontal subsurface flow were used to treat dairy wastewater in a 2 x 2 factorial design consisting of two wetland cells with vegetation and two with supplemental aeration. Four tracer studies were conducted between November 2004 and May 2005. Two key observations were made, demonstrating that vegetation and aeration can be utilized in cold regions to prevent clogging and freezing, thereby reducing preferential flow paths which can reduce treatment efficiencies: (1) vegetation contributed to thermal protection and (2) aeration increased temperature and mixing. A comparison of multiple wetland cells with varying flow rates showed that the use of pore volume in tracer response curves was a better indicator of preferential flows than other indicators including volumetric efficiency, hydraulic efficiency and number of continuosly stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). This research helps further establish how constructed wetlands are a viable tool for treating wastewater in cold climates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to high organic loads and suspended solids and due to insufficient wastewater treatment, surface waters are polluted by effluents of carrot washing, as shown for one enterprise in Germany. Over a period of four months the water quality was studied at the stages of a treatment system consisting of a grit chamber, a settling tank combined with aeration devices and a constructed wetland. Organic pollutants were measured as COD and BOD(5) in different fractions of the wastewater. The daily washing of carrots produces up to 300 m(3) wastewater with a mean filterable solids content of 453 mg l(-1) and a mean COD concentration of 179 mg l(-1). On average the current efficiency of total COD reduction is 52%. Due to the fine grain size and the low density of suspended solids, settling is very slow and incomplete, primarily during the winter. As much as 29 mg COD l(-1) in the effluent derive from the fraction of particles which do not settle within 18 hours. The dissolved COD fraction accounts for 30 mg l(-1) and reflects the insufficient oxygenation of the wastewater. Strategies for enhancing the removal of organic compounds can be derived from the results of this study. Spatial separation of settling and aeration processes is recommended to optimise the treatment process. Furthermore, the area of the constructed wetland should be increased to maintain its hydraulic conductivity and to guarantee a high COD reduction.

The deep water populations attained a higher harvestable shoot biomass and a lower rhizome biomass with increased growth in root structure thus significantly enhancing the nutrient uptake rates leading to a higher accumulation of shoot bound macronutrients. However, the accretion of excessive amounts of autogenous shoot litter coupled with slower decomposition rates under anaerobic conditions in the two deep water populations led to higher nutrient enrichment in sediments and overlying water column causing subsequent eutrophication with signs of growth inhibition including typical stress symptoms like stunted growth and chlorotic shoots. The shallow water population that intermittently experienced alternative inundation-drawdown pattern depicted an unaffected continuation of seasonal growth affirming that strict water regime management practices coupled with timely mowing or the removal of accumulating litter are necessary to ensure long-term survival of healthy E. sphacelata stands when it is used in applications where deep water conditions prevail.

Analytical approach to study of redox properties of constructed wetland	CHEMICKE LISTY			Czech	Article							PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; POLAROGRAPHY; IRON	The aim of this study was to test the potentials of modem analytical methods in the determination of redox properties of constructed wetland. The contents of indivi-dual oxidation states of iron in wastewater samples were determined as an indicator of the redox character of a reed-bed wastewater treatment plant in addition to monitoring their redox potentials. Fe(II) was determined by the 1,10-phenanthroline method, total iron content was determined after reduction of Fe(III) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Differential pulse voltammetry served as a comparative method for iron determination. The contents of sulfates, sulfides and dissolved and precipitated manganese species in wastewater samples were also determined. The presence of sulfides in samples documents reducing properties of the wetland system. Fe(III) detected in samples is the result of wetland aeration via the roots of vegetation. The aeration in the presence of redox potential gradients strongly affects the processes of wastewater treatment. The conditions and processes inside the reed bed of a constructed wetland are very difficult to study due to high heterogeneity and complexity of the system. The precise analytical methods used for real samples, with necessary modifications, may afford a tool for studying artificial and natural ecosystems.

The aeration of a wetland via the roots of the vegetation (and a subsequent formation of redox-potential gradients) strongly influences the wastewater treatment efficiency, and thus it represents one of the most important characteristics of the wetland. The concentration ratios of individual iron oxidation states (Fe(II) and F(III)) were determined as the indicator of the redox properties of the constructed wetland reed bed during this study. Interstitial water from the wetland was sampled eleven times throughout the year 2005. The spectrophotometric method using 1,10-phenanthroline was properly optimized (limits of detection and quantification, sensitivity, linear dynamic range, repeatability, and accuracy values were assessed) and applied for iron determination. Most of iron, ca. 98%, is reduced to the Fell form in raw wastewater and water from the inflow zone of the constructed wetland, however, at the outflow and in the vegetation bed both iron oxidation states are usually detected. The presence of Fe(III) in the reed bed (ca. 10-30% for some samples) demonstrates the aeration of the wetland by the vegetation (Phragmites australis) resulting in a re-oxidation of Fe(II)..

Most cyanide compounds in tailings ponds are in the free and "weak acid dissociable" (WAD) forms, being the majority of these as copper-cyanide complexes. Taking into account that natural degradation processes in tailing ponds reduce the toxicity of cyanide over time, the named passive systems can be considered as a potentially applicable treatment technology to detoxify leachates with residual cyanide content after the tailings ponds closure. Then, wetland-based passive systems have been experimented at laboratory and field scale at the site of a gold mine in northern Spain. At the laboratory scale, test included static aerobic cells, anaerobic dynamic columns, oxidation cascades and wetland. Average removal rates for Cu and other metals reached values in the range of 90-99%. A pilot scale passive system, constituted by aeration cascades and aerobic and anaerobic cells, has been constructed at the site of the mine. Results suggest that these technologies are able to detoxify leachates with residual cyanide concentrations in about 25% for dissolved cyanide and more than 90% for metals.

Two modes of PAVB operation were compared. In the first mode, "continuous feeding," an uninterrupted flow of wastewater was applied to the bed until clogging, followed by a "rest period" to regenerate pore space. During the rest period only passive aeration was provided by recirculation of clean effluent through the bed. In the second mode, "intermittent feeding," a daily schedule of 8 h of wastewater flow to the bed followed by a rest period of 16 h was employed. The results indicate that continuous operation is advantageous over intermittent operation. A high COD removal rate of about 800 g/ml/day was obtained when the system operated in the "continuous feeding" mode and the COD removal efficiency was about 50%. Clogging of the bed with apparent ponding occurred at a free pore space of 30 to 35% from its initial value. During both continuous and intermittent modes of operation, an irreversible clogging of 40% was observed. Higher organic removal efficiency was achieved by operating three vertical bed units in a series. The overall average COD and BOD reductions in the vertical bed system were 83 and 88%, respectively, with effluent CODt concentrations between 50 and 128 mg/L and BOD concentrations were between almost zero and 45 mg/l. In contrast to PAVB for tertiary treatment, no significant advantage was shown in using passive aeration when the PAVB was used for secondary treatment with a relatively large particle size (15 mm).

However, the knowledge about sulphate reduction and the effect on the removal of C and N in constructed wetlands is still limited. Investigations in laboratory-scale constructed wetland reactors were performed to evaluate the interrelation of carbon and nitrogen removal with the sulphate reduction by use of artificial domestic wastewater. Carbon removal was found to be only slightly affected and remained at high levels of efficiency (75-90%). Only at sulphate reduction intensities above 75 mgl(-1) (50% removal), a decrease of carbon removal of up to 20% was observed. A highly contrary behaviour of ammonia removal was found in general, which decreased exponentially from 75% to 35% related to a linear increase of sulphate reduction up to 75 mgl(-1) (50% removal). Since sulphate removal is considered to be dependant on the load of electron donors, the carbon load of the system was varied. Variation of the load changed the intensities of sulphate reduction immediately, but did not influence the carbon removal effectiveness. Doubling of the carbon concentration of 200 mgl(-1) BOD5 for domestic wastewater usually led to sulphate reduction of up to 150mgl(-1) (100% removal). The findings show that, particularly in constructed wetland systems, the sulphur cycle in the rhizosphere is of high importance for performance of the waste water treatment and may initiate a reconsideration of the amount of sulphate present in the tap water systems.

J	Bezbaruah, AN; Zhang, TC				Bezbaruah, AN; Zhang, TC			Quantification of oxygen release by bulrush (Scirpus validus) roots in a constructed treatment wetland	BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING			English	Article						constructed wetland; plant oxygen release; microelectrode; active lateral root; radial oxygen loss	PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; RHIZOSPHERE; MICROSENSOR; PLANTS; RICE; MICROELECTRODE; PERMEABILITY; AERATION; CATHODE; GROWTH	Amount of oxygen released by bulrush (Scirpus validus) roots has been quantified based on the radial oxygen loss (ROL) exhibited by the roots, the number and the length of active lateral roots, and the field plant density. It was found that wetland bulrush contains two types of active lateral roots (showing ROL), viz., laterals of brown and white main roots. The two laterals have distinct oxygen release characteristics. Based on the dissolved oxygen (DO) microprofiles of brown and white laterals, the ROLs were found to be approximate to 61 ng O(2) cm(-2) root surface min(-1) and = 68 ng O(2) cm(-2) root surface min(-1) respectively, at bulk 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)) of 76 mg L(-1). The respective average active root lengths of the brown and the white laterals were approximate to 40 and 1676 mum. Based on field and laboratory measurements, the average amount of oxygen released by bulrush was found to be 2.30 mg O(2) m(-2) wetland surface d(-1); of this approximate to 71% is from the white roots. The results of this study indicate that plants do not release enough oxygen to meet the total oxygen demand of bulk wastewater, and therefore, constructed wetlands should be designed as an anaerobic or an aerobic anaerobic hybrid system rather than as an aerobic system. However, the results of this study should be viewed in the background of possible errors (including a reactor design flaw), which might have made the measured oxygen release significantly lower than what plant roots actually release. Further studies are needed to quantify wetland plant oxygen release based on micro-scale measurements. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The potential nitrification of the upper layer of the dry bed could not be attributed primarily to autotrophic nitrification, or the nitrifying bacteria in this layer could be facultative heterotrophs, whereas autotrophic nitrification is predominant in the upper layer of the wet bed. It also was found that changing aeration conditions in the lower layer of the dry bed have resulted in a lower diversity of the microbial community and led to a relative depletion of easily degradable soil carbon resources.

This article gives an overview of how the vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland has affected the aeration capacity and purification efficiency of the constructed wetland system in a one-year period of operation. The aeration capacity of the VSSF CW averaged 63.6 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) during this one-year operational period, and aerobic processes occur more effectively in the system. An area of 0.5 m(2) pe(-1) is most likely too small for sufficient aeration in cold climates, and the short water residence time in the VSSF CW also can hinder nitrification. Also, an analysis of the application of the k-C* model in the horizontal subsurface flow part of the Kodijarve hybrid constructed wetland is presented for BOD, total nitrogen, ammonium and total phosphorus. The k-C* model describes processes in the HSSF CW quite well. The k values are found to be smaller than reported in the literature, mainly because of the low hydraulic loading rates. Low k values in more oxygen dependent processes, such as BOD, N-tot, and NH4-N removal, also indicate insufficient oxygen supply in the system.

A compact vertical flow constructed wetland system serving a single household has been under constant sampling and the results provide valuable experience on the construction, operation and maintenance of this type of system. The compact vertical flow system consists of a sedimentation tank, a pumping well from which the water is pulse loaded onto a planted bed with a surface of about 3 m(2) per PE and a filter depth of ca. 1 m. The bed is filled with local filter sand and winter insulated with a layer of wood chips. The distribution system is installed on top of the bed, under the insulation, and operates under pressure to obtain an even distribution of the water. At the bottom of the bed the water is collected in drainage pipes which are connected to the atmosphere to enhance aeration. The bed is planted with Phragmites australis. Following the bed a P filtering unit containing calcite is installed. After the P filter a device in a splitting well allows the recycling of determined volumes of water to the sedimentation tank in order to improve removal of total nitrogen. The initial results show that the system can effectively meet the stringent Danish discharge standards while maintaining a small surface area per pe served. The construction costs are generally similar to that of constructions of soak-away systems. Initial experience with the external calcite-based P-filter unit which is included in the system was promising. Unfortunately, the commercial supplier of the calcite material can no longer deliver the material, and attempts to find alternative suppliers and/or materials have failed. The initial experiences from the system however gave valuable information on some construction and operations issues that improve the performance of vertical flow constructed wetland systems. In particular recycling within the system improves and stabilises performance.	Univ Aarhus, Dept Biol Sci, Aarhus, Denmark	Arias, CA (reprint author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Biol Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.

Transformations of inorganic forms of nitrogen and heterotrophic microbial activities were studied under aerobic and under anaerobic conditions. The gravel substrate was sampled from the upper and from the lower layers of two constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The substrate with pore water was then incubated in a flask in constant temperature under aerobic (air) or under anaerobic (helium) conditions. After 7-days incubation inorganic forms of nitrogen, gaseous products like CO2, CH4 and N2O were analyzed. Concentration of TON and of TIN increased in the pore water during 7 days of aerobic incubation. Under aerobic conditions nitrification was occurring in all samples from the upper and from the lower layers of the gravel bed of both constructed wetlands. However, the rate of nitrification was lower in the lower layer of constructed wetland as compared to the upper layer. No N2O was detected in any sample under anaerobic conditions. Either low denitrification activity or reduction of N2O to N-2 was the reason. Aerobic heterotrophic microbial activities (CO2 production) were the highest in the upper layer of the Ostrolovsky Ujezd constructed wetland. Afso anaerobic microbial activities (CO, production and methanogenesis) were the highest in the upper layer of Ostrolovsky Ujezd constructed wetland. Rates of nitrification, CO, production and methanogenesis were lower in the Slavosovice constructed wetland as compared to Ostrolovsky Ujezd constructed wetland.

The system consisted of 3 equal-sized beds operated in series. The study concentrated upon the nitrification that could be achieved in such a system. In the tidal flow system at the start of the treatment cycle the wastewater is fed below the surface into the aeration pipes. It then percolates upwards until the surface is flooded. When the surface is completely flooded the pump is stopped and the wastewater is then held in the bed in contact with the bacteria growing on the media. A set time later the wastewater is drained downwards. After the water has drained from the bed the treatment cycle is complete and air diffuses into the void spaces in the beds. The cycle is then started again. This system has the advantage of avoiding clogging of the surface which can be a problem in conventional vertical flow systems where the wastewater is fed directly onto the surface. The fill and drain cycle was 2 hours in length. Recirculation of part of the effluent was used in the tests in an attempt to improve oxygen transfer. The paper reports on the performance of the system specifically with respect to nitrification performance and also regarding the oxygen transfer rates that can be achieved in this system and in comparison with conventional VF systems. The 3 year part-time study evaluated the system performance over a range of concentrations and ammonia loading rates. The system achieved 90% removal of BOD(5) and Suspended Solids. The trials started in June 1999 and were continued until September 2002. In the early tests the ammonia concentration was in the range 50 tol 50mg NH(4)N/litre. The degree of nitrification achieved was 41% removal of ammoniacal nitrogen when operating at a loading rate of 9.8 g NH(4)N m(-2) d(-1). but this dropped to only 24% when the loading rate was increased to 16.3 g NH(4)N m(-2) d(-1). In a later trial when the system was fed with a lower feed concentration in the range 30 to 60 mg/litre the ammonia removal was pushed up to an average of 58%. During these latter trials the Oxygen Transfer Rate [OTR] was measured at 30 g O(2) m(-2) d(-1). which is comparable with conventional VF systems. The system was built at the offices of ARM Ltd and fed with sewage from a septic tank for part of the trial and an ammonium sulphate solution for the remainder of the period.

In fact, in countries like Portugal, Spain, and many others, significant amounts of investment will be addressed in the next few years to the construction of small Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP). The problems faced when constructing and operating WWTP serving small communities may be relevant when energy and labour costs are relatively high, or when the visual impact on the surrounding areas is especially negative. Sustainable treatment solutions require the selection of appropriate technologies using fewer resources. In this paper, information is presented about sustainability indicators of twenty-one small secondary wastewater treatment plants, including conventional (trickling filters and extended aeration plants) and non-conventional treatment systems (constructed wetlands). The data refer to allocated areas per inhabitant, amounts of concrete per inhabitant, power per inhabitant, and construction and installation costs per inhabitant. The data seem to show that for different reasons, constructed wetlands are promising treatment solutions for application to rural areas in particular because of the relatively low power requirements and relatively low construction costs for served populations below 500 inhabitants.

Temporarily anaerobic conditions in the Kodijarve HSSF system did not allow efficient removal of BOD7, NH4-N, N-tot and P-tot. In 2002 a vertical subsurface flow filter was constructed to enhance aeration. The design of the system was based simply on the oxygen demand of the wastewater and on the aeration potential of vertical flow wetlands. The vertical flow system has shown satisfactory results. The purification efficiency of BOD7 in the Kodijarve CW has improved significantly and there has been a slight increase in purification efficiencies of NH4-N and N-tot. On the other hand, the removal efficiency of P-tot has decreased significantly. Although, the mass loading rates have increased, mass removal rates of all four parameters have improved significantly. Nevertheless, optimization of the constructed wetland system is essential in order to meet effluent standards during wintertime.

The pilot system, consisting of 4 cells, each dosed at a nominal flow rate of 5.4 cubic metres per day, was operated between August and December 2002. The pilot tested the effects of wetland mulch and aeration on system performance. Areal rate constants (kA values) were calculated based on an assumed three tanks in series (3TIS). The presence of wetland sod and aeration both improved treatment performance. Mean kA values were 244 m/yr for cells without sod or aeration, and improved to 356 m/yr for cells with sod and aeration. Based on the results of the pilot system, a full-scale wetland system (capable of operating at 6,000 m(3)/day) was started up in May 2003. The full-scale system achieved permit compliance within one week of startup, but is currently being loaded at only 45% of the design hydraulic load, and 15% of the design BTEX mass load, resulting in a mean kA value of similar to 350 m/yr.

The ORP at the lateral root surface was between +250 and +317 mV and gradually reached the bulk solution ORP (+14 to -54 mV) at a radial distance of similar to4,750 mum. DO values at the lateral root surface varied from 0.64-2.04 mg L-1 as bulk biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) changed from 24 to 1,267 mg L-1. DO at the lateral root surface and the thickness of the oxygen layer around the root marginally increased with an increase in bulk BOD, while ORP at the lateral and main root surface decreased. pH and DO values did not change near the main root and had the bulk solution values. The results of this study provide insights into root-induced microenvironments and would be helpful for the quantification of the total amount of oxygen contributed by plants in constructed wetlands.

Often the COD of the recycled effluent does not satisfy the German wastewater administration directive. Therfore, it should be shown for a carrot producing enterprise, how the removal of organic compounds can be enhanced in order to improve the treatment efficiency for the carrot washing water. During four months the water quality was studied at five stages of the treatment system consisting of a grit chamber, a combined settling/aeration tank and a constructed wetland. Organic pollutants were measured as COD, BOD(5) and TOC in different fractions of the wastewater. The daily washing of carrots yields in about 300 M wastewater which is highly loaded with organic and inorganic solids. On average the efficiency of total COD reduction is 52 %. Due to the fine grain size and the low density of suspended solids, there is a very slow and incomplete settling. 29mg COD L(-1) in the effluent even derivefrom the fraction of particles which do not settle within 18 hours. The dissolved COD fraction attributes to 30 mg L(-1) and reflects the insufficient oxygenation of the wastewater. To optimize the treatment process a spatial separation of settling and aeration processes is recommended. Further the area of the constructed wetland must be increased to maintain its hydraulic conductivity and to obtain a high COD reduction.

In spring and autumn removal efficiencies were found to depend on the nitrogen load in a linear mode. The efficiencies in winter and summer differed extremely (mean removal rates of 0.15/0.7gm(-2)d(-1) (11%/53%) in January/August) and were independent of the nitrogen load (0.7-1.7 g m(-2) d(-1)) in principle. Oscillations of the removal rates in spring, forming several maxima, suggest seasonal specific effects caused by the dynamics of the plant-physiology finally determining the nitrification efficiency, i.e. via O-2-supply. Nitrification is limited by temperature during all seasons and surprisingly in midsummer additionally restricted by other seasonal aspects forming a clear-cut relative nitrification minimum (mean rate of 0.43 g m(-2) d(-1) (32%)) in July. The importance and the effect of the plants' gas exchange and oxygen input into the rhizosphere are discussed. Denitrification was nearly complete in midsummer and was clearly restricted at seasonal temperatures below 15 degreesC. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, the project objective was to determine full-scale, subsurface-flow constructed wetland retention times and treatment performance through assessment of water quality by daily sampling of total dissolved solids, pH, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand (COD), tannins, nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, and sulfide across operating systems for winery wastewater treatment. Measurements were conducted during both the fall crush season of heavy loading and the spring following bottling and racking operations at the winery. Simple decay model coefficients for these constituents as well as COD and tannin removal efficiencies from winery wastewater in bench-scale reactors are also determined. The bench-scale study used upward-flow, inoculated attached-growth (pea-gravel substrate) reactors fed synthetic winery wastewater. Inlet and outlet tracer studies for determination of actual retention times were essential to analyses of treatment performance from an operational subsurface-flow constructed wetland that had been overloaded due to failure to install a pretreatment system for suspended solids removal. Less intensive sampling conducted at a smaller operational winery wastewater constructed wetland that had used pretreatment suspended solids removal and aeration indicated that the constructed wetlands were capable of complete organic load removal from the winery wastewater.

The present system had a nitrification zone plus a sulfur/limestone (S/L) autotrophic denitrification zone followed by an anaerobic polishing zone and was operated with and without aeration. The wetland had only 80% organics removal and no net nitrogen removal when there was no artificial aeration. However, almost 100% organics removal and similar to81-90% total inorganic nitrogen (TIN = NH4+-N + NO2--N + NO3- -N) removal were achieved when the oxic zone of the system was aerated with compressed air. S/L autotrophic denitrification contributed 21-49% of total NO3- -N removal across the whole wetland and 50-95% across the S/L column. TIN and NH4+ -N in the effluent were always <5.5 and < 0.7 mg L-1, respectively, when the feed had NH4+-N less than or equal to 35 mg L-1. Sulfate removal of similar to53-69% was achieved in the anaerobic polishing zone. The position of the S/L column was changed 0.78, 2.24, and 2.69 m from the inlet), and no remarkable difference in nitrogen removal was observed. However, without the S/L column, TIN removal decreased to similar to74%, and the effluent NO3- -N increased about two times 19.13 mg of N L-1). The present study has demonstrated the possible use of S/L autotrophic denitrification for nitrate removal in a constructed wetland.

We studied nutrient removal processes (nitrification, denitrification, phosphorus removal) in activated sludge systems using the mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) analysis. Stabilization of the nutrient removal process in the reconstructed Polva wastewater treatment plant was studied. Nitrification rates of activated sludges from Estonian conventional wastewater treatment plants are low, up to 2 mg NO3- -N g(-1) MLSS h(-1) at room temperature. Observed specific denitrification rates ranged from 0.1 to 12.1 mg NO3 -N g(-1) MLSS h(-1) at room temperature. Different nitrification and denitrification rates for various activated sludges were observed. Also, these rates differ for the same activated sludge type. Michaelis-Menten kinetics constants for denitrification regarding nitrate concentration maximum specific rate V-max and half-saturation constant K-NO3 were obtained. Reciprocating technology can be widely used in new constructed wetlands. Also, it can significantly improve the purification efficiency of existing wastewater treatment wetlands with low aeration capacity.

Subsurface flow constructed wetlands, 2.3 m wide by 4.8 m long and containing a gravel matrix, were used to investigate the impact of wetland depth, inlet pipe location, loading volume, and plants on water flow. Flow patterns were determined using blue dye or bromide as tracers. The blue dye adsorbed to the gravel and was not an effective tracer for following water movement. Water dispersed as it flowed through the wetland, and approximately two pore volumes of added water were required to displace approximately 99%. of the bromide tracer added as a pulse. In 17 and 25 cm deep wetlands, water flow was uniform with depth, and inlet depth had little influence on water flow patterns. Water flow in a 40 cm deep wetland was not uniform with depth for either inlet pipe placement. The presence of plants caused preferential water flow around root masses, thereby, limiting their potential to interface with wastewater. Water mixing by dispersion from the surface to deeper depths may enhance aeration. Bromide was first detected in effluent after only 0.5 pore volumes of tap water had been added. This indicates flow constructed wetlands. This occurrence should be considered for time-dependent treatments, such as fecal coliform and biological oxygen demand reduction.

For that reason nowadays hybrid constructed wetland with mixed vertical and horizontal flow of sewage are highly recommended. In such system vertical bed has an very important role in oxygen support especially when sewage are dewatered on the bed periodically. The lack of knowledge concerning efficiency of contamination removal in growing and post-growing seasons in wetland make the authors to present the results of carried out research. It was determined that the analysed hybrid constructed hydrophyte plant in post-growing season was supplied with less amount of sewage with higher concentration of contaminations in comparison to growing season. The efficiency of organic matter and phosphorus removal was similar in both seasons main difference was obtained for nitrogen compounds removal efficiency. The VF-CW bed in both seasons has very important role in aeration of sewage.

It is the largest and the most intensively used river basin in Taiwan. Based on the results from the pollutant sources investigation and water quality analysis, the main water pollution sources of the Kaoping River were livestock wastewater from hog farms, municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater, leachate from riverbank landfills, and non-point source (NPS) pollutants from agricultural areas in the upper catchment. Concern about the deteriorating condition of the river led the Government of Taiwan to amend the relevant legislation and strengthen the enforcement of the discharge regulations to effectively manage the river and control the pollution. The following remedial strategies have been taken to improve the river water quality since 2001:(1) hog ban in the upper catchment of the Kaoping River Basin, thus, 510 thousand hogs have been removed/relocated; (2) removal of riverbank landfills; (3) Cr enforcement of the industrial wastewater discharge standards; (4) sewer system construction in five cities along the river corridor; (5) application of best management practices for NPS pollutant control; (6) application of natural wastewater treatment systems (e.g. land treatment, constructed wetland, overland 0 0 flow, riverbank sedimentation/aeration pond) for domestic wastewater treatment in rural areas; and (7) W construction of the watershed geographical information system (GIS) and real time water quality monitoring system to effectively monitor and manage the watershed. Recent water quality investigation results indicate that the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nutrient loadings to the Kaoping River have been significantly reduced and the water quality has been improved after the implementation of the remedial strategies described above. Results and experience obtained from this study will be helpful in designing the watershed management strategies for other similar river basins.

Wetlands may be supplemented by other treatment system components, such as aeration, ponds, and filters. This paper describes two such systems that operate seasonally in cold climates, one at Cambridge, Minnesota, USA for six years, the other at Saginaw, Michigan, USA for three years. The Cambridge system consists of extraction, cascade aeration, settling, surface flow wetland treatment and wetland infiltration. The Saginaw system consists of extraction, aeration, settling, intermittent sand filtration, surface flow wetland treatment with recycle, and discharge to a river. Both are less than one hectare in extent, but treat the full leachate flows. Ammonia is a principal contaminant of concern, because it occurs at high concentrations, especially in young leachates. Cambridge reduces 5-15 mg L(-1) down to less than 1.0 mg L(-1) in a nominal detention time of 12 days, and Saginaw reduces 300-500 mg L(-1) to less than 20 mg L(-1) in 25 days. Metals reductions ranged from nil for copper, to 98% for iron at Cambridge, and 85% for copper and 79% for zinc at Saginaw. Volatile organic compounds were removed to below detection. Base neutral organics, PCBs and pesticides were also removed to below detection. Removal rates from the domestic wastewater literature gave reasonable predictions of performance. The economics of both systems were very favorable.

About 25 % of contained ammonia was converted to nitrate, about 10 % was consumed by the plants and up to 30 % was converted to nitrogen gas. This maturation effect was attributed to increased depth of sludge from sedimentation of ochre, providing increased surface area for immobilisation of ammonia oxidising bacteria. The surface flow wetland finally removed 23 g m(-2) day(-1) ammonia in comparison with 3.8 g m(-2) day' for the subsurface flow (pea gravel) wetland cells, constructed for the present work and dosed with ammonium salts. Removal of ammonia by both systems was consistent with well-established mechanisms of nitrification and denitrification. It was also consistent with ammonia removal in wastewater wetland systems, although the greater aeration in the minewater systems obviated the need for special aeration cycles. The general role of wetland plants in such aerated conditions was attributed to maintaining hydraulic conditions (such as hydraulic efficiency and hydraulic resistance of substratum in subsurface flow systems) in the wetlands and providing a suspended solids filter for minewater.

CW2D is able to describe the transformation and elimination processes of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Simulation results are shown for an indoor pilot-scale constructed wetland. A good calibration of the flow model was possible for the pilot-scale constructed wetland and therefore the results of the reactive transport simulations with CW2D fit the measured data well. A sensitivity analysis shows the most influential parameters of CW2D. The parameters of the model that describe the properties of the unsaturated zone turn out to be the most influential parameters. Besides hydraulic parameters the oxygen re-aeration rate, and yield coefficients and lysis rates of the micro-organisms are the most important parameters. The result of the sensitivity analysis also supports the statement that good results with CW2D can only be achieved when a calibration of the flow model is possible.

B	Wallace, SD		Nehring, KW; Brauning, SE		Wallace, SD			On-site remediation of petroleum contact wastes using subsurface-flow wetlands	WETLANDS AND REMEDIATION II			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Wetlands and Remediation	SEP 05-06, 2001	BURLINGTON, VT	Battelle Mem Inst, Earth Tech, US Dept Def, Geomatrix Consultants Inc, USN, Naval Facilities Engn Command, Parsons Engn Sci Inc				Williams Pipeline Company operates a terminal facility in Watertown, South Dakota. The facility generates large quantities of petroleum contact waste in the spring and summer months. Petroleum contact waste is characterized as storm water runoff, hydrostatic test water, or other water sources that have come in direct contact with petroleum products. The combined petroleum/water waste is routed through an oil-water separator and stored onsite. The waste has characteristically high levels of BTEX as well as elevated concentrations of CBOD5 and Ammonia. The high CBOD5 and Ammonia concentrations impeded the performance of an existing physical/chemical treatment works, resulting in permit noncompliance. Several biological treatment processes were tested at the pilot scale, but none proved feasible due to short residence times and the high oxygen demand of the influent waste. In July 1998, a subsurface flow constructed wetland was installed onsite. The 16,000 square foot (1,486 square meter) wetland was designed to process a flow-equalized input of approximately 400 gallons per day (1.5 cubic meters per day) on a seasonal (May - October) basis. To provide adequate oxygen transfer, a Forced Bed Aeration(TM) System (US Patent 6,200,469) was built into the wetland bed. The system was initially planted with Phragmites communis and overseeded with Phalaris arundinacea. Average influent CBOD5 (at 20% of the bed length) was approximately 10,000 mg/L (as high as 16,000 mg/L) with effluent concentrations (at 80% of the bed length) averaging approximately 6 mg/L. Influent ammonia concentrations (at 20% of the bed length) averaged approximately 100 mg/L (as high as 230 mg/L) with effluent concentrations (at 80% of the bed length) averaging approximately 0.5 mg/L. Numerous transect samples were collected during 1998 and 2000. In most cases, BTEX was removed in the first 40% of the bed length. BTEX removal is believed to be largely a function of enhanced volatilization as a result of the aeration system. CBOD5 and Ammonia removal appears to follow a first-order exponential decay pattern, in most cases reaching non-detect levels at 80% of the bed length. Due to the water vapor loss induced by the aeration system and the high evapotranspiration conditions of a South Dakota summer, the wetland has operated as a zero-discharge system since startup. Because the processing capability of the wetland has exceeded initial design expectations, wastes from other facilities in North and South Dakota are now brought to the Watertown wetland for treatment.

However, innovative design can adapt wetland systems to use areas that may not be initially considered (e.g., development edges). By establishing many smaller wetland treatment systems in a distributed fashion, iterative collection and treatment of nonpoint- and diffuse- source pollution is possible, with the cumulative result being much reduced loadings at a watershed scale. Due to their passive nature, establishing numerous small-scale wetlands would not result in the prohibitive operational or maintenance requirements that would be encountered if using more operationally-intensive, conventional treatment technologies. A small, two-stage wetland treatment system was designed to remove iron from the leachate of a small decommissioned landfill. The first cell is an anaerobic surface-flow cell, utilizing sulfide precipitation. The second cell, preceded by cascade aeration, is an aerobic vertical upflow cell with replaceable media, in which oxide/hydroxide precipitation and humic bonding are the primary removal mechanisms. The resulting system not only allows remediation of the iron loadings to the creek and is aesthetically compatible with its setting, but demonstrates the feasibility of using small-scale constructed wetlands in an urban setting, in what may become a distributed collection of numerous passive treatment systems designed to reduce the cumulative loadings of diffuse source pollution.

Primary products produced by the dairy include specialty cheeses. The system consisted of a septic tank, subsurface flow constructed wetland and an infiltration bed. Due to the cold climate, the wetland and infiltration bed were insulated with mulch. The wetland has operated since startup without freezing problems. Quarterly sampling was initiated under the County operating permit. The initial round of sampling showed influent concentrations far higher than expected for CBOD5 (2,820 mg/L vs. 174 mg/L design value). Further investigation revealed that the facility piping resulted in most of the cheese processing waste being diverted to the septic system. Core sampling of the septic tank revealed large accumulations of cheese solids. Organic overloading of the subsurface flow wetland was obvious, with anaerobic protein degradation within the subsurface flow wetland causing a net production of ammonia. This organic loading, if left unabated, would cause rapid biomat plugging and hydraulic failure of the infiltration bed. In April, 1999, an aeration system (Forced Bed Aeration(TM)) was retrofitted to the wetland cell to increase the oxygen transfer rate. The aeration blower was operated intermittently from April to July 1999 due to startup problems, and full-time thereafter. Since initiation of full-time aeration, CBOD5 removal improved from 17% to 94%, while Total Nitrogen removal improved from 44% to 74%. This performance improvement indicates that the wetland reactor had adequate detention time and surface area for CBOD5 removal, but was initially limited by the oxygen transfer rate. Total Nitrogen removal is still limited by the ability to oxidize ammonia, indicating that there is still not enough oxygen available to completely satisfy both the carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxygen demands.

This facility will have a fully functioning subsurface flow wetland to treat the storm runoff from the barnyard and milk house waste. It will also include pilot-scale wetland cells, aeration systems, re-circulation capability, and in-situ sensors. The overall goal of the CWC is to conduct integrative constructed wetland research for agricultural and environmental applications. Particular emphasis during the first year will be to develop appropriate wetland treatment systems for working farms in cold regions. Related laboratory research is being conducted to study the biological degradation rates of subsurface flow bench-scale wetland reactors used to treat a synthetic dairy waste similar to the barnyard runoff. Side by side comparisons of planted reactors and unplanted reactors are being performed. Soft stem bulrush is the plant of choice. Systems with and without supplemental aeration are also being compared. The results of this laboratory research will be used towards the development of future experiments at the research facility and provide a basis for treatment expectations of the full-scale wetland system.

Many existing treatment options create excessive waste solids or fail to remove nutrients, which, upon discharge, impact groundwater and aquatic systems. This study evaluated nitrogen removal in an ecologically engineered wastewater treatment system (the Solar Aquatic System (TM) [SAS]) that combines aeration and activated solids recycling with aquatic and constructed wetlands treatment components. A septage-treating SAS in coastal Massachusetts, USA, produced an effluent of 113 mg/l chemical oxygen demand, 16 mg/l total suspended solids (TSS), 0.56 mg/l ammonium nitrogen, 6.1 mg/l total nitrogen and 1.5 mg/l total phosphorus. Waste solids production was low at 0.81 g/g influent TSS, including harvested plant biomass. Primary treatment was by biological oxidation with activated solids, followed by gravity clarification, Further oxidation and ammonium removal occurred in planted aerated aquatic tanks enclosed in a greenhouse, followed by secondary gravity clarification. Nitrogen removal in the aquatic tanks was limited by denitrification, which was limited by the availability of anaerobic microsites. Mineralization of particulate organic nitrogen, followed by nitrification and denitrification, occurred simultaneously during primary treatment and in the aquatic tanks. Final solids polishing and denitrification occurred in a constructed wetland. Although 88% of the influent nitrogen was removed during primary treatment, further treatment in the aquatic tanks and wetlands was required to reduce effluent nitrogen to tertiary standards. Nitrogen removal in the whole system was primarily by sedimentation of waste solids, accounting for 57.6% of the influent nitrogen, followed by denitrification, at 40.9%. Direct uptake of nitrogen by plants was insignificant, at 0.5%. 1.0% of the total influent nitrogen left the facility in the effluent water. The SAS has the capability to treat septage to tertiary standards with low solids production in small, decentralized facilities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It often invades wetlands where with its vigorous propagation can outcompete rare plant communities, On the other hand, invasion by this species in water polluted habitats seems to be beneficial and the decline of its population in some areas, such as the lake Trasimeno in Italy, is accompanied by enhanced water pollution. In fact, Phragmites can thrive in shallow and almost stagnant water, where few others species can survive, because its dense and vertically extended rhizome mat, anchored to the shore, takes up nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). It has been hypothesised that this habit favours the degradation of some chemical compounds in the rhizome and the removal of heavy metals from the water, The capacity to oxygenate the rhizome is at the basis of these activities. Thus, Phragmites has features particularly relevant to its potential use to remediate the contamination of wetlands by agriculture run-off, Actually, it has been already included in constructed wetland to clean civil and industrial wastewater with a high load of organic pollutants. In this paper we will analyse and integrate with new results the current knowledge on the biological characteristics of this species. We will also analyse how it interacts with the environment.

The model consists of six submodels, including the nitrogen and carbon cycles, both autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria growth and metabolism, and water and oxygen balances. Data from an existing constructed wetland in Maryland were used to calibrate the model. Model results reproduced seasonal trends well. Interactions between the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen cycles were evident in model output. In general, effluent biochemical oxygen demand, organic nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate concentrations were predicted well. Because little is known about rootzone aeration by wetland plants, oxygen predictions were fair. The model is generally insensitive to changes in individual parameters. This is due to the complexity of the ecosystem and the model, as well as the numerous feedback mechanisms. The model is most sensitive to changes in parameters that affect microbial growth and substrate use directly. This dynamic, compartmental, simulation model is an effective tool for evaluating the performance of subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. The model provided insights into treatment problems at an existing constructed wetland. With further evaluation and refinement, the model will be a useful design tool for subsurface-flow constructed wetlands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The first two unplanted cells provide preliminary treatment. Specific gravel depths and ensuing biofilm growth provides anaerobic treatment in Cell 1 and anaerobic treatment in Cell 2. Cell 3 was planted with Typha latifolia with an inserted layer of brick rubble (for phosphorus removal). Locally grown reed, Phragmites karka was planted in Cell 4. COD was reduced from 8420 mg/l 3000 from Cell 1 to the outlet of Cell 4. Likewise other parameters: total and dissolved solids, ammonium and total nitrogen, and total P, indicated declining trends at the 4-celled CW effluent, This study reveals how high strength distillery wastewater strongly impacts morphology, aeration anatomy in the chiseled plant tissues, reed growth; and composition of the biofilm in the specialized substratum. The reliability of a CW for organic and nutrients reduction, in association with a poorly performing conventional system is discussed. There is an immense potential for appropriately designed constructed wetlands to improve high strength wastewaters in India.

The primary requirement of the newly developed treatment system is to control the concentrations of glycols following their use as de-icers and anti-icers within the airport. The ability of reedbeds to contribute to this treatment role was fully tested through pilot scale, on-site experiments over a 2 year period. The average reductions in runoff BOD concentrations achieved by pilot scale surface flow and sub-surface flow reedbeds were 30.9% and 32.9%, respectively. The corresponding average glycol removal efficiencies were 54.2% and 78.3%, following shock dosing inputs. These treatment performances are used to predict the required full scale constructed wetland surface areas needed to attain the desired effluent water quality. The treatment system also incorporates aeration, storage and, combined with reedbed technology, has been designed to reduce a mixed inlet BOD concentration of 240 mg/l to less than 40 mg/l for water temperatures varying between 6 degreesC and 20 degreesC.

The simulated wastewater was supplied continuously. The presence or absence of reeds or the aeration of the substratum had the greatest effect on the rates of decolourisation of dye. Those planted with Phragmites australis removed the largest quantity (91%) of both types of dye. Most of the azo dye is removed in the first 12 hours by adsorption (57%), largely to organic matter (31%) and to roots and rhizomes (8%) present in the substratum. After the first 3 days of exposure the efficiency of decolourisation increases by approximately 1 mg/dm(3)/day.

Inflow water to the wetland contains between 15 to 20 mg/L of C-5-C-12 hydrocarbons, including 50% BTEX compounds. When the wetland subsurface is aerated to prevent freeze-up during winter, hydrocarbon removal efficiency is 100%. Without aeration, hydrocarbon removal varies from 30% to 100%. Removal efficiency correlates with temperature. Hydrocarbons not removed in the wetland are subsequently removed due to natural processes along the outflow channel. At present, the main hydrocarbon removal mechanism appears to be volatilization, and to a lesser extent, biodegradation and dilution. The ability of a large plant rhizosphere surface area to enhance biodegradation will be evaluated as the plants become fully established. Direct plant uptake of hydrocarbons will also be assessed.

One of the most important aspects with regard to landfills is the treatment of the expected polluting leachate emissions, requiring simple and low-cost systems. PI combination of aeration, Jams and filtering techniques is likely to result in the best treatment options. Biological treatment systems, like aerated lagoons or sequenced batch reactors in combination with natural systems like soil infiltration, spray irrigation, filtration or constructed wetlands can be cost-effective systems for MSW leachate treatment in Norway. Aerated lagoons appeared to he an efficient treatment stags for landfill leachate treatment in cold climates. The hydraulic retention time should be >20 d to keep the nitrifiers in the lagoon during periods with low temperatures. Landfills can be grouped into categories depending on landfill size, age, hydrology and climate before evaluating sampling programmes Frier to treatment system installation and Juring operation. Simple filtration techniques with bark and crushed concrete can significantly improve leachate quality during treatment and remove nitrogen, colour, heavy metals ansi pesticides, buffer the pH and add phosphorous.

During the draining process, air is positively drawn from the atmosphere into the bed so the aeration of the system is significantly improved A pilot-scale tidal flow reed bed system was studied for the treatment of agricultural wastewater, which was prepared by diluting pig slurry. At an average influent BOD(5) of 649 mg l(-1) and ammoniacal-nitrogen of 333 mg l(-1), the BOD(5), COD, SS and PO(4)-P levels were reduced by 71.0, 58.3, 65.2 and 38.7%, respectively. The removals of BOD(5) COD, SS and PO(4)-P increased with their influent strengths in straight line correlations. The NH(4)-N was reduced by only 13.3% through the system; 69.0% of this removal resulted from nitrification into NO(2)-N and NO(3)-N, whereas 31% of the removal was due to other processes. The average oxygen consumption rate in this tidal flow system reached 203 gO(2) m(-2) d(-1), significantly higher than the rates obtainable in horizontal flow and downflow reed beds. The rhythmical air and water movement in the tidal flow system enhances the oxygenation ability of the beds and improves the efficacy of utilisation of the available bed volume. Accordingly, tidal flow reed beds appear to have much potential as initial treatment stages for small amounts of strong waste effluents where the bulk of the BOD(5) removal can take place.

Unfortunately, they also provide habitat for mosquitoes that can be nuisance pests and transmit pathogens such as arboviruses and malaria. In Australia, Ross River virus is responsible for thousands of cases annually of a disease that is severely debilitating, has regional incidence rates often exceeding 1:1000, and costs millions of dollars in health and other impacts. Disease transmission depends on mosquito species and abundance, and extent of contact with humans; the characteristics and siting of wetlands determine hazards, and indicate risks for nuisance or disease. Mosquito control should not rely solely on chemical and biological agents. Design of wetlands is important: shallow water and dense vegetation promote mosquito production. Deeper habitats with cleaner steeper margins, and more open water, produce fewer mosquitoes. Water and vegetation management can reduce mosquitoes: aeration and sprinkler systems, and flooding and drainage regimes, can reduce larval densities; vegetation thinning can assist mosquito predators. Such measures may appear incompatible with objectives and operations of wetlands, but mosquito management must be an integral objective of modern wetland design and maintenance in order to minimise health hazards.

J	Cottingham, PD; Davies, TH; Hart, BT				Cottingham, PD; Davies, TH; Hart, BT			Aeration to promote nitrification in constructed wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						constructed wetlands; reed beds; nitrogen removal; nitrification; denitrification; aeration	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS; NITROGEN; PLANTS	As part of a three year study of the use of reed beds for the treatment of wastewater, two pilot scale constructed wetlands (30m x 5m), one planted with Phragmites australis and the other serving as an unplanted control, were used to treat primary domestic sewage. This paper describes an experiment conducted to test the hypothesis that increasing available oxygen by aeration of the wastewater in the treatment beds could increase nitrification and hopefully nitrogen removal rates. Prior to aeration, the influent nitrogen load in the wastewater passing through the beds was reduced by approximately 45% and 10% in the planted and control beds respectively. With aeration of the wastewater as it passed through each bed, nitrogen removal was approximately 51% and 20% for the planted and control beds respectively. High rates of nitrification were recorded for the planted bed with aeration, but removal of nitrogen by denitrification was limited, probably because of the absence of a suitable carbon source (indicated by low BOD(5) concentrations). High nitrification rates were not recorded in the unplanted control bed. The higher BOD(5) concentration measured in this bed may have caused increased competition for available oxygen between heterotrophic bacteria and the relatively slow-growing nitrifying bacteria, resulting in lower rates of nitrification but more efficient denitrification.

The nitrification in the vertical-flow beds (VFBs) is clearly determined by the oxygen balance in the filter. Full nitrification can only be achieved when the oxygen balance is positive. For sizing purposes equations for the calculation of oxygen demand and oxygen input are given. Three possibilities to achieve sufficient soil aeration are presented and explained. For the denitrification two possibilities are presented. From technical wastewater treatment plants predenitrification is well known. Return rates up to 200% can be used without hydraulic problems for the VFBs. In cases of low CM ratios an additional application of HFBs has to be used. The design can be carried out using a design of 1 g NO3-N/m(2), d achieving a 65% removal in more than 90% of the cases. The paper discusses some of the equations presented internationally. The suitability of the use of k-values for the processes nitrification and denitrification is especially questioned. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Microbes cultured from the rhizosphere of bulrush (Scirpus robustus) plants showed higher Se volatilization than those from bulk soil of a flow-through, constructed wetland area contaminated with selenite. The data show that bacteria are the dominant microbes involved in Se volatilization; fungi contribute relatively little to this process. Bactericides significantly decreased both Se volatilization and the number of culturable bacteria in rhizosphere cultures compared to an untreated control. In the absence of added C, Se volatilization was greatest from selenomethionine, then selenite, then selenate. Aeration substantially increased the percentages of Se volatilized from rhizosphere soil cultures to which no C was added. Up to 95, 21, and 3% of the Se was volatilized from selenomethionine, selenite, and selenate, respectively. When both C and aeration treatments were applied to the rhizosphere cultures, the corresponding percentages changed to 20, 57, and 4%, that is, selenomethionine volatilization by rhizosphere microbes decreased when C was added while selenite volatilization substantially increased. Since selenite volatilization was the greatest when rhizosphere microbes were supplied with C and aeration, we suggest that microbes in this selenite-contaminated wetland are adapted to volatilize Se by using C released from roots, and that Se volatilization may be enhanced by oxygen and environmental conditions provided by the plants.

The aim of the project is to try to improve the normal downflow reed bed design so that it is able to operate for more than a few days without resting the bed. By ensuring that the system is not limited by the supply of oxygen to the matrix it was anticipated that higher removals of COD would result. Higher organic and hydraulic loadings were also anticipated. The initial results of the experiments have been very promising. In the first series of experiments the reed bed was fed with a wastewater with a COD of 1200 mg/l and ran for 36 days without rest; it showed no sign of needing to be rested. The average COD removal for this period was 59%. In the second run a range of increasing strength wastewaters were fed to the bed at increasing hydraulic loadings. Hydraulic loadings up to 5m(3)/m(2)/d were achieved with good COD removals.

The media filter consisted of a tank (1.5-m-diameter x 0.6-m-height) filled with marl gravel. The marl gravel had a carbonate content of 300 g kg(-1). Gravel particle size distributions were 85 and 14% in the 4.7-to 12.7-mm and 12.7-to 19-mm size classes, respectively. Pore space of the filtration unit was 57%. Wastewater flow rate was 606 L m(-2) d(-1), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) load was 198 g m(-2) d(-1). The media tilter removed 54% of chemical oxygen demand (GOD) content after one cycle, but increased cycling did not produce additional COD reduction. Total suspended solids (TSS) removal after one cycle was 50% of initial levels, and additional cycling reduced TSS levels at a much lower rate of 7% per cycle. Removal efficiencies for total phosphorus (TP) ranged from 37% to 52% (one to four cycles), but long-term phosphorus removal would be limited by the sorption capacity of the gravel. Up to 24% of TKN was converted to nitrate-plus-nitrite-N (NO3+NO2-N). Effluents with high NO3+NO2-N levels can be treated further for denitrification with constructed wetlands or anaerobic lagoon. This is important in cases where land is limited for wastewater application.

These include aquatic vascular plants, aquatic mosses and some larger algae. The presence or absence of aquatic macrophytes is one of the characteristics used to define wetlands, and as such macrophytes are an indispensable component of these ecosystems. As the most important removal processes in constructed treatment wetlands are based on physical and microbial processes, the role of the macrophytes in these has been questioned. This paper summarizes how macrophytes influence the treatment processes in wetlands. The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects the presence of the plants gives rise to. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for physical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate the surface against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the type of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification.

Growth responses of Melaleuca to secondary treated effluent (100%-approximately 5mgPL(-1) and 8mgNL(-1)), half strength (50%), P enriched (+P) and N enriched (+N) secondary treated effluents were monitored in a 2 year pot trial. A growth index was derived from measurements of height, girth diameter, branch number and new leaf number. Highest rates of growth were achieved in the +N and 100% treatments, and lowest rates in the +P and 50% treatments. Seasonal growth trends were evident. Continuously waterlogged trees had slightly higher growth rates than those subjected to aeration cycles, demonstrating their suitability to wetland environments. An aerated network through the bark extending to the roots may provide a mechanism of root aeration. Biomass and nutrient partitioning were measured in an experimental constructed Melaleuca wetlands receiving pure effluent. Biomass nutrient accumulation rates were comparable to studies of other macrophytes. M. alternifolia stored approximately three times more N and P than M. quinquenervia. However, M. quinquenervia had higher rates of litter fall induced by severe insect damage, increasing the rate of transfer of nutrients to the long term sediment sink. P concentrations in the senescent leaves were highly responsive to external concentrations, and may be used as an indicator of P loading rates in constructed wetlands. Since senescent leaves provide a major pathway of biomass nutrients into the sediment sink, this provides a self regulating P storage mechanism. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Plants were grown in triplicate 0.238 m(2) x 0.6 m deep gravel-bed wetland mesocosms fed with dairy farm wastewaters pre-treated in an anaerobic lagoon. After 124 days, mean species total biomass ranged from 0.3 to 7.4 kg m(-2), with above-below-ground ratios between 0.35 and 3.35. Growth of Baumea and Jnncus was relatively poor. Zizania and Glycen'a showed the highest above-ground biomass values, ranging between 3 and 4 kg m(-2). Above-ground tissue concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) ranged from 15 to 32 and 1.3 to 3.4 mg g(-1), respectively. Maximum plant accumulations of 135 g N m(-2) and 18.5 g P m(-2) accounted for around 30% of the levels supplied in wastewaters. Mean removals of 76-88% of suspended solids, 77-91% of biochemical oxygen demand, and 79-93% of total P were recorded for the established mesocosms irrespective of plant species. Mean removal of total N ranged from 65 to 92%, showing a significant positive linear correlation with plant biomass. Comparisons are made with information from Other studies on establishment rate, productivity, nutrient uptake, potential for root-zone aeration and general life history traits in constructed wetlands.

This is primarily due to oxygen limitations. Nitrification does occur in conventional wetland treatment systems, but typically requires long hydraulic retention times. This paper describes a study that first evaluated the capability of subsurface flow constructed wetlands to treat a high strength seafood processor wastewater and then evaluated passive aeration configurations and effluent recirculation with respect to nitrogen treatment efficiency. The first stage of a 2-stage wetland treatment system exhibited a relatively short hydraulic retention time and was designed for BOD removal only. The second stage wetland employed an unsaturated inlet zone and effluent recirculation to enhance nitrification. Results indicate that organic loading, and thus BOD removal, in the first stage wetland is key to optimal nitrification. Passive aeration through an unsaturated inlet zone and recirculation achieved up to 65-70 per cent ammonia nitrogen removal at hydraulic retention times of about 3.5 days. Inlet zone configuration and effluent recirculation is shown to enhance the nitrogen removal capability of constructed wetland treatment systems.

The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Acts (RCRA); and EPA subtitle D regulations, as well as stringent State regulations, impose minimum criteria for municipal solid waste facilities in the areas of location, operation, groundwater monitoring, and leachate management. In conjunction with these State and Federal mandates the University of West Florida developed a leachate treatment technique utilizing extended aeration and surface-flow constructed wetlands. Sampling of water quality has occurred monthly since February 1992. Parameters examined include: Nitrogen (NH3,), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Phosphate (TPO4), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), pH, Alkalinity, and Chlorides. Chemical Oxygen Demand (GOD), Total and Fecal Coliforms, Priority Pollutant Metals, and limited organic analytes are sampled on a less frequent basis. Samples are collected at a raw leachate site (L(0)), primary aerated lagoon (L(1)), and 6 stations within the 1.1 hectare constructed wetland complex (S-1; W-1; W-3; W-5; W-7; W-9) and one sandfilter (SF) location. Results thus far indicate removal percentages of the tested analytes average between 64% and 99%. This data suggests various physical, microbiological and chemical processes occurring within the aerated lagoon and constructed wetlands can provide an effective alternative to standard techniques for landfill leachate treatment and disposal. The methods as described have proven to be ideal for the circumstances occurring at the Perdido Landfill.

BOD and suspended solids are removed up to 95% from 10-250 mg l(-1). Surface flow systems in Yorkshire achieved higher effluent standards but generally lower mass load removal than subsurface flow systems. All wetland systems fill up with solids at a predictable rate, and if they are not removed or degraded, they will overflow. Ammonia is not normally oxidised, except where relatively large land areas are used and/or BOD falls below 20 mg l(-1). Phosphate is accumulated until saturation, Bacteria (faecal indicators) are removed, sometimes almost completely, but not reliably. The established theoretical knowledge of sewage treatment processes explains the performance of wetlands. Plants provide a renewable support medium for microbial growth, a matrix to retain solids and assist plug flow hydraulics, but do not appear to provide oxygen. BOD removal is mainly by the aerobic breakdown of organic matter. Bacteria growing on the soil and f-horizon (Litter layer) use oxygen from the atmosphere and from nitrate in the sewage. Wetlands are oxygen limited and performance is enhanced if extra aeration is provided. There were no obvious performance differences between surface and subsurface flow systems, unless extra aeration was involved, though strict comparative data were not found. Vertical flow wetlands appear to be inefficient percolating filters. The simplest designs, construction methods, maintenance and rejuvenation methods should be used. Near design performance of surface flow wetlands is achieved in about 14 days.

The pilot wetlands began operation July 1, 1991. Monitoring ended june 30, 1993. Removal rates and outflow concentrations for five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) depended most on hydraulic loading rates (HLRs). Two-year average removal efficiencies for these constituents were above 67%. Slight color and total dissolved solids reductions were seen at the lower HLPs tested. Deep zones enhanced flow distribution, increased hydraulic residence time, and significantly increased pollutant assimilation in the pilot wetlands. The wetland cells reduced or eliminated chronic toxicity to cladocerans and fathead minnows. The most suitable plant species in the wetlands were cattails, bulrush, and sawgrass.

The most important functions of the macrophytes in relation to the treatment of wastewater are the physical effects brought about by the presence of the plants. The macrophytes stabilise the surface of the beds, provide good conditions for pbysical filtration, prevent vertical flow systems from clogging, insulate against frost during winter, and provide a huge surface area for attached microbial growth. Contrary to earlier belief, the growth of macrophytes does not increase the hydraulic conductivity of the substrate in soil-based subsurface flow constructed wetlands. The metabolism of the macrophytes affects the treatment processes to different extents depending on the design of the constructed wetland. Plant uptake of nutrients is only of quantitative importance in low-loaded systems (surface flow systems). Macrophyte-mediated transfer of oxygen to the rhizosphere by leakage from roots increases aerobic degradation of organic matter and nitrification. The macrophytes have additional site-specific values by providing habitat for wildlife and making wastewater treatment systems aesthetically pleasing.

The Venturi-convection is driven by a pressure differential created by wind blowing across tall dead culms which sucks air into the underground system via culms snapped off close to ground level. The results demonstrate how wind, by increasing Venturi-induced convection, and how radiant energy, by increasing humidity-induced convection, raise the oxygen concentrations in the rhizome system, thereby causing much greater fluxes of oxygen into root and rhizosphere than are achieved if rhizome aeration is by diffusion alone. In laboratory experiments convective flow rates of as low as 0.7-1.4 x 10(-8) m3 s-1 (approx. 20-40 mm min-1 in the rhizome) were sufficient to raise rhizome oxygen concentrations to 90 % of atmospheric. The significance of this is discussed in connexion with pollution control by constructed wetlands, and photographic evidence is provided of the rhizosphere oxidizing activities in soil and anaerobic solution. A mathematical model is derived to help to evaluate the contributions of convection and diffusion in rhizome aeration, and to assess the likely effects of root and rhizosphere oxygen demands.

In the barrier islands of South Carolina the problem is further complicated by very restrictive water quality discharge regulations. On Fripp Island an activated sludge system has been employed to produce an effluent suitable for land disposal on the golf course. Use of the water in this way is economically attractive and minimizes the costs associated with golf course maintenance. The process can be modified to provide substantial nitrogen for the golf course turf requirements. On Hunting Island a total oxidation system which operates poorly is being replaced with a combined trickling filter and aeration system which should allow maximum flexibility dealing with highly variable effluent loadings. The effluents from this system will be discharged through a constructive wetland avoiding any surface water discharge. The combination of these facilities results in a highly environmentally satisfactory discharge program. Sludge from the biological treatment operations on both Fripp Island and Hunting Island can be combined to produce sod for use on the golf course. Composting offers an alternative method of sludge disposal which is also environmentally satisfactory.

A comparison of the capital, operating and maintenance costs of biological filters, bio-discs, stabilisation ponds and an extended-aeration-activated sludge system suggest that stabilization ponds may be regarded as a low cost, low energy waste-water treatment system. However, in some instances, due to legal and land requirements they are not appropriate. In these instances a number of interacting factors play a role in determining the lowest cost option. The capital construction and operating costs of constructed wetlands are similar to those of stabilisation ponds but due to lack of full scale operational information they are not yet widely used as a waste-water treatment system.
